final grades posted,as you probably know final grades are now posted on sio for some of you the grade is not exactly what you predicted it would be please understand that we do not issue grades solely based on a total score we use the total score as a guide but we examine your overall performance in determining your final grade in some cases although the grade was at the far bottom of what you thought was the range for a specific letter you got the letter below that for example if you had a total the grade may have come out as a d generally a lower grade than expected is issued because the exams were far lower than the homework or because the grade was higher due to exams but many programming assignments were very low or missing etc if we saw a student where one part of their grades was way out of alignment with the rest of their grades this did not convince us to give the higher grade we discussed each of these at length there is no absolute borderline between grades for example an a is not or higher we examine students near that number above and below on a case by case basis which is why grades didn't come out quickly some go up to a some go down to b depending on overall performance on exams where you do not have extra help and then the assignments for more information http www cs cmu edu about shtml grading we will answer each question we do get as soon as we can but unless there was a computation error in our grade spreadsheet or an entry error we will not be changing final grades we wish you the best for the winter break and hope that it is restful best wishes for the new year tom iliano pin,public,final
question about grades,hi i was wondering if there is any chance that the final grades could be changed after today i read the email you sent out about our grades reflecting our performance in class and i feel pretty awful that i had a b all semester because i had put a lot of effort into the hw assignments but because of my poor performance on the midterms my performance is considered c material,private,final

clarifying undefined behavior,int main int a xcalloc sizeof int all elements initialized to zero int b for b a b b printf d b free b return why is b not permanently assigned to a so that free is valid is it because it is in the for loop is a way to fix the reading uninitialized memory b undefined behavior is allocate memory for b in beginning if you allocate the memory for b initially the values array elements for b would be the same as a because of the for loop correct,private,written12

aadds clarification,hi i wanted to clarify what the s means in a elems s i the writeup says that we then use element size s stored with the array to compute the address of ith element so now my understanding is that s is a elt size but that doesn't make sense because you can't multiply a type by i an int do you mean the size of the array which would then be a count thank you,private,c0vm
task,when it says the implementation of allocation must take care to initialize all memory requested by c to all zeros does that mean that xcalloc has to be used versus xmalloc for the function new i created a void a xmalloc s where s is size and pushed the address of a onto the stack would that be incorrect since i to initialize the all memory to all zeros if i need to use calloc would i do void a xcalloc s sizeof char,private,c0vm
aaddf adding to pointer,hello i believe i've narrowed down a bug in my code to the aaddf operation from what i understand aaddf takes an f type one byte argument pops a pointer off the stack increments the pointer by f bytes then pushes a pointer onto the stack since char is a byte type we can convert void to char and then do pointer arithmetic by adding f in my test on the right the size of arri should always be except after opcode the aaddf operation the size of arri is assigned to a seemingly random value it appears that the pointer is incremented wrongly so it points to the wrong memory address from all of my googling and looking at the lecture notes my pointer arithmetic appears to be accurate can you help me thanks,private,c0vm
invokestatic stack logical issues,hi i just had a quick question about restoring the stack in invokestatic and return so i noticed in the writeup and the file prog hints txt based on the way it was worded we need to push the state of the stack onto the callstack before we pop off the arguments v vn from the stack if so wouldn't this cause an error in leaving the arguments for that function on the stack even after the function has returned a value or if popping off the values after pushing the frame onto the callstack still removes those values from the stack then why does initializing a new stack in s not completely wipe away the old stack being saved and thus make saving the state useless i apologize about the confusion and thank you for any help,private,c0vm

having trouble calling function inside a function in c vm,for case invokestatic i don't know what it means to continue executing the codes inside this sub function according to my understanding the codes are not included in the main function's byte code but is rather a separate bytecode field inside the function pool index if this is the case how can i execute the hidden byte code inside the function should i create a new struct bc file and use this to call execute again actually i want to know how can the byte code from the sub function be executed without having to call execute again case invokestatic this is calculating function's index pc uint t index uint t uint t p pc pc index uint t uint t p pc this stores length of function code uint t length bc function pool index code length this allocates a new frame for the sub function c v stack t s local c v stack new ubyte p local bc function pool index code size t pc local c value v local xcalloc bc function pool index num vars sizeof c value this gives the sub function its arguments for int counter counterfunction pool index num args counter v bc function pool index num vars counter c v pop s this pushes frames on callstack push callstack void s push callstack void v push callstack void pc length this is where i don't know what to do while c v stack empty s local pc local break pc size t pop callstack v c value pop callstack s c v stack t pop callstack c v push s result free something here break,private,c0vm

garbage collection,when valgrinding the completed vm it looks like there are multiple memory leaks from according to the output of leak check full allocating memory with the new instruction and i'd assume from newarray as well which is to be expected as it's never explicitly freed however the writeup lists no mechanism by which to keep track of memory allocated by c and c pointers to such so there isn't any way to free such memory are we supposed to roll our own structure for this advice would be appreciated edit leak check full also reports a leak with the line that calls the function from native function table,public,c0vm

freeing elements of operand stack,hi i'm working to gain back the points deducted by the valgrind checks in autolab and having some trouble i think it stems back to my operand stack from what i understand in the write up we are provided a function to free the operand stack but not the elements in the operand stack so we need to manually free those elements if this is wrong then my problem is somewhere else entirely in c vm h i see that c value is a struct and there is also a pointer in the struct to p both of which need to be freed am i on the right track with this if not i'm at a complete loss as to where the valgrind points are going i have made sure to free all of the char for the error messages after calling the error function on those messages and free s and p operand stack and ubyte do you have any advice guidance p s auto lab says valgrind is detecting error so there's one tiny itty bitty error somewhere common between return and shladd,private,c0vm

task imload,so i'm slightly confused about task for imload we have that s a s x when i tried to cast and do x a it said that it won't let me do that because c value is a unary does this mean we have to convert using val ptr and then dereference a to get the byte integer in the allocated memory since a is essentially a pointer to an allocated memory if so do we use val ptr constantly,private,c0vm

standard char and byte,the writeup says the c vm main function checks to make sure that an int is bit can we assume does it check that char is bit and byte is bits and rereading the writeup pretty much answered my question,public,c0vm

question a alphabetical order,just to clarify in question a when we visit a vertex we explore its outgoing edges in alphabetical order using depth first search as an example does that mean we add neighbors to the stack in alphabetical order which means if we had neighbors b and e we would visit e first since it would be at the top of the stack or should we add neighbors to the stack in a manner that would give us alphabetical order when we pop from the stack if we had b and e we would visit b first since it would be on the top of the stack,public,written13

c's memory model,when we do an array allocation such as int a malloc sizeof int we are essentially allocating a space in memory of say bytes of each int is bytes so if that's the way allocation in c works that means it doesn't really care what we put in this array or rather address as long as we stay within the byte range is that right so if i were to allocate something like this and say add bytes of characters instead that still wouldn't be an error is that right or would the compiler flag that is this the kind of thing we could check using contracts or something does xmalloc or xcalloc make a difference i'm also very unclear about when to use xmalloc and when to use xcalloc is there a general rule to help with that,public,lectures

functions pointers and typedefs oh my,question c of written covered function pointers in c which is a fairly complicated and confusing topic here's a brief summary of how to deal with functions and function pointers all you're actually responsible for to pass a function as a pointer use foo where foo is the function name to call a function to which we have a pointer use bar args where bar is the pointer to typedef a function type do typedef func type name there are other ways of doing it that also work but this is the clearest way i e the way we expect you to do it now in case you are curious here is a more in depth explanation of why we do this and why other things work as well this is beyond the scope of the class but you may find it helps you to understand some of the properties of function pointers to understand function pointers first we must understand functions here is a diagram of the layout of memory as a program is executing which you may recall seeing a few weeks ago when you first learned about the stack and the heap the section of interest is the 'text' section which contains the compiled machine code which tells the processor what operations to perform in a manner similar to how c bytecode directs the c vm each function appears at its own place in the text section say you have a function call foo the compiler will determine the address where the instructions for foo will reside so when foo is called the processor jumps to that address and begins executing the appropriate instructions so a function name is technically just a pointer to the machine instructions encoding the function sometimes we want to pass a function as an argument for example client interface functions for a generic data structure library implementation or store it in a variable this is achieved by passing in the pointer to the machine code encoding the function the most clear way to represent this is using the address of operator like foo we will ask you to pass functions in this way technically the ampersand is optional since the function name itself is a pointer in fact foo foo evaluates to true try it yourself you may see other people pass functions without the address of operator but we will be pedantic and use the address of operator and ask that you do the same say we have some function type func that takes no arguments and func bar is a pointer to a function that adheres to this type since functions are pointers it's true that bar bar just like with the ampersand the asterisk is optional we could call the function like bar or bar these expressions are completely equivalent we will ask that you explicitly dereference a function pointer before calling it since it's more clear semantically we can view this as dereferencing bar to get the function it points to then calling it however note that bar is something entirely different since c will evaluate the function call first and then dereference the result which could be unsafe and is likely not what you want anyway to be safe any time where there are two operators and it's not obvious which will execute first you should include parentheses to disambiguate now what's the deal with typedef the type of a function is defined by the type of the argument s and the type of the return value the function's definition as loves to say is a value so the typedef defines this information for some function type for reasons i'll explain in a second the type is associated with a function pointer so the typedef has the form typedef functype where return type is the type a function with that type returns functype is the name of the type and the second set of parentheses contains the type of the arguments separated by commas i'll try to illustrate with an example say we have a few functions which take an array of chars and its length and returns an int int foo char array int len int bar char input int size int baz char arr int num how would we define the type of the functions note that foo bar and baz are all pointers to different locations in memory which encode the functions so the type is really a property of the machine code encoding the functions not the pointers hence the dereference function pinters,public,written12

question about ht insert,from the starter code in board ht h i see this ht insert h e has no return value because it should have as a precondition that no struct currently in the hashtable contains the same board as dat board from what i understand ht lookup should return null if the board we're looking up doesn't exist so ht insert should check to see if ht lookup of the board it's trying to insert returns null in a precondition is this incorrect because i have this as a precondition in ht insert requires ht lookup h dat board null but i'm getting this error in autolab board ht c in function 'ht insert' board ht c error invalid operands to binary have 'struct board data' and 'void ' requires ht lookup h dat board null from what i googled it seems like i mixed up pointer types but i'm not sure how what am i missing thanks,private,lightsout

issues casting from a hdict key to a bitvector type,so as i understand our key for our hash table is a pointer to the bitvector board which we can access by dat board for my hash function i want to actually look at the bits of the bitvector but since the hdict key is a void pointer i'm not sure how to go about doing that i tried doing this which might be totally wrong i'm just really confused at this point bitvector b bitvector x where x is of type hdict key but i'm getting this error cast from pointer to integer of different size which i think makes sense since my bitvector in this implementation is uint t but but i'm not sure how to reconcile that issue i'd really appreciate some guidance thank you,private,lightsout

board ht c,hello i am working on the board ht c right now but i have a question related to the pointer issue i don't understand why we save the pointer of the board as the key because it's just that i don't understand how we retrieve something from the table if we have boards with the same value but with different addresses so i tried to change the hash function to retrieve the value of the pointer when hash is being called but for some reason that still doesn't find the key for example if you save the pointer of the board as the key for example if you store the board and and you store its pointer as the key which is going to be some address like x then later if you try to find a board with the same value but this one would have a diff address like x you will never find it from the table this is the part that i am confused about,private,other

board ht key hash and value free,since each unique board state has a unique bitvector each board's bitvector could be directly turned into an index for the hash table array the largest boards we must solve are x which would have unique board states however this would result in an array of size load factor of with a load factor of the array is still size which is over million and with a load factor of the array size is over million with higher load factors access time becomes too slow so i did not consider them is it acceptable to have the hash table array be so large or should i not even worry about this and assume the provided hash table implementation is sufficiently time and space efficient,private,lightsout

key hash and value free,i'm a little confused by what is asked of us in task if the key is a bitvector and we don't know how it is implemented how are we supposed to write a hash function for it the same question applies for writing the value free function since value is an instance of the struct board data and we don't know how board bitvector is implemented how are we supposed to know if we need to free whatever is stored in the board field,private,lightsout
clarification on task,i am confused by what the following sentence means the value stored in the hash table should be a pointer to the struct board data dat that is passed to ht lookup does this simply mean i would have hdict insert h dat board dat as in the value is stored in the hash table should be a pointer to the struct board data dat this value is also passed to ht lookup i don't understand what the last part of the sentence means at all a pointer to the struct dat is passed to ht lookup and then included in the hdict insert call but ht lookup takes hdict t h and bitvector b there's nothing about a struct board data in those parameters i'm really confused,private,lightsout

ye ole list of c questions,so i've made at least questions about c so far since they were unrelated but i'll put future ones all in here first off it's pretty unfair to ask us to write code in c after a single class on c there's been nothing taught about arrays nothing on pointer arithmetic nothing on how sizeof works i guess google is our friend anyway answered can you allocate bits with xmalloc or xcalloc answered malloc and calloc return void pointers some tutorials online often casted the pointer to the type they needed when assigning char foo char malloc sizeof char is this the general convention what if sizeof char was replaced with sizeof char or answered how exactly is malloc calloc xmalloc xcalloc i saw somewhere realloc and sizeof supposed to work when i ask for a pointer to bits from xmalloc and store that in an int pointer foo and then call sizeof foo i would get the size of a single int right is it possible to use sizeof to determine the actual size allocated or do programmers just have to keep that straight themselves int foo xmalloc printf size u bits sizeof foo i should see as an output size bits right answered it seems that we iterate through arrays by jumping forward a certain number of bits from a starting pointer a k a pointer arithmetic from instructor answers on posts we shouldn't need to know about pointer arithmetic for this assignment if that's the case how should we be handling arrays actual arrays do exist in c too but the writeup seems to ignore those in fact the writeup tells us to convert c arrays to memory blocks pointed to by a type pointer edit my pointer arithmetic example was wrong i fixed it i think c int foo alloc array int foo foo printint foo c int foopnt xmalloc sizeof int pointer method mentioned by writeup foopnt pointer arithmetic is this even right int fooarr actual arrays in c printf u and u should be foopnt fooarr right answered edit how exactly does free work if i assign int sizes to an int pointer and then free that pointer does all the memory get freed or is just a sizeof int portion freed int foo int xmalloc sizeof int free foo what's freed and what's left do i have to do free foo i with i from edit how does the back end of translating abc to a char array work it seems that assigning a char to a string literal and then later trying to free that pointer will cause a seg fault is memory for const types cleared automatically or do they just persist until termination char str this is a string str ' ' this should cause a segfault since str really has type const free str this also causes a segfault free char str do i have to cast to free seems counter intuitive these are just questions i have right now i'll add more to this list if more come up so i won't fill up piazza trying to learn c,public,strbuf

correctness and cstring c,can we assume the cstring library functions work correctly there are no ensures statements on a bunch of the functions there i e there's no ensures strcmp str str on the strcpy function even though the idea of copying means the result should be equal to the original since our contracts in strbuf c need to prove correctness and we shouldn't duplicate cstring library code how should we go about proving correctness,public,strbuf

general style question,is it preferable to declare c strings like so const char s blahblah and then be forced to litter your code with char casts which just defeats the purpose or just drop the const from the declaration and skip formalities or should we just allocate the string on the heap i just wanted to know what most c programmers consider good form,public,other strbuf
pointer syntax,before switching to c most pointer declarations follow this kind of syntax int p alloc int but i've noticed that a lot of them look like this now instead int p alloc int both of these mean the same thing to the compiler right and writing it the old way won't affect our grade,public,other

next programming assignment due,is next programming assignment due on nov th or nov st by the way how many programming assignments that we haven't done yet,private,other
specific question about a,the code i initially wrote down to solve the problem made it went like while stream empty s pq add q void get report s if pq full q pq rem q so that it would take a report from the stream and then delete the lowest element if the priority queue is full what i'm concerned with is that it might not take some cases into consideration for example if we're at our second to last loop and the queue is full we would remove the smallest element in the priority queue regardless of the value of the next report in the stream if the final report in the stream has a smaller price increase than the element we remove wouldn't that be against what we are going for in the assignment to have a priority queue containing the n reports with the highest price increases so in order to address this issue i've been struggling to be able to make comparisons between elements in the priority queue and reports from the stream without having to lose said report we are comparing i thought i could use the syntax using ' ' and ' ' but that doesn't seem to do the trick either i'm not sure if i'm being too specific with this question but i'll delete it immediately if that is the case,private,written10

dealing with logarithms in big o,so for a number of the problems in written i found that the worst case total runtime complexity of a function would be something like this log log log log n now this technically is equivalent to log n but is that the best way to express this or since we are adding terms and log n is going to be the biggest should we just put log n as the big o function,private,written10

written hw a,the comments state that we should put stock reports into the queue one by one and that if we find the queue full after an insertion we should remove the one with lowest price increase however there is no guarantee that the next report we add is greater then the one we removed so wouldn't this fail to give us the largest n price increases edit since the if statement for full comes after the add there doesn't seem to be a way to use the conditional to check for the greatest price increase in one line,public,written10

infinite loop when undoing a move on the board,for my recursive case i first call a function that calculates all the possible moves for a board and put those in a stack then i'm checking to see if the stack is empty and if its not i pop the first move off of it and apply said move onto the board and also add it to the solution stack then i recurse on my modified board and check if that recursive function call returns if not i pop the move off my solution stack and use the move to undo the changes to my board the code for the above is here int solve board b stack s int pegs requires is board b requires pegs ensures is board b ensures result int row int col int row int col int solution if pegs return else stack possible moves get possible moves b if stack empty possible moves move m pop possible moves row m start row col m start col row m end row col m end col apply move b row col row col solution solve b s pegs push s m if solution move u m pop s undo b u m start row u m start col u m end row u m end col above restores board return num pegs b the issue is that when i undo the move for the english txt case it's hitting a dead end at pegs and then just recursing all the way back to the top so it's saying the board is unsolvable and at its best attempt gets down to pegs a ta said it was because i'm only checking the first move of all possible moves in my recursive case but when i try to loop through all the possible moves by changing the if statement to a while loop so i keep going until my stack of possible moves is empty my function infinite loops i guess this is because my possible moves stack will never be empty so i'm not sure how to move forward any advice on how to make sure i check all the possible moves for the current board properly thanks and sorry for the long question,private,peg

peg autolab timeout,hi i encountered several timeout errors on autolab and i checked the previous piazza found out these four reason may cause timeout are you copying the board if so there's a more efficient way are you performing unnecessary stack operations like flipping them very often there may be a better way are you generating moves quickly do you have multiple levels of nested loops levels the second point here should i generate a board when i recursively called the board which means once i have a new board i will generate a stack full of its posssible moves i think this is the only problem i have because within my solve function or even my generate moves fun i only use one loop thanks,private,peg
restoring the board during backtracking,this is probably a question with an obvious answer but i just want to make sure for task if i come across a board that there is no solution to and i want to backtrack and undo the move i just made should i manually go in and modify the board using the move i just popped off my solution stack or is there an easier way to do that,private,peg
getting an error saying that functions from peg main c have been defined more than once,i tried submitted to autolab and got this error error function 'is coord' defined more than once which is because i copied and pasted some functions from peg main c into my peg c file but the writeup says to do that in the second paragraph on page and if i dont have those functions in my peg c my code doesn't compile anyways what am i doing wrong,public,peg
pushing moves onto the stack in the correct order,i just wanted to make sure i understood this part correctly so with recursion each time we reduce the board down to a smaller version of the problem aka a board that's a little more solved right so when we find a move that works we apply it and recurse with the new modified board but when we push the move we want to make onto our stack since we want the moves to end up in the correct order at the very end we can't just push it before recursing right since if we just keep pushing moves onto the top of the stack each time we recurse won't we eventually have the final move that solves the board and leaves peg at the top of our stack when that isn't correct so do we recurse and then push the move so that when it finishes each function call it starts from bottom up and pushes the moves in the correct order onto the stack starting from the almost solved board to the original board not sure if that made sense it wasn't worded in the best way please correct me if i'm wrong thanks edit never mind i answered my own question it works,private,peg

efficiency peg,my peg implementation produces the right answer but it takes longer than s autograder timeout for the unsolvable x boards x a txt on autograder currently my approach is to check if numpegs base case otherwise get a stack of all possible moves loop through this stack and try to solve for each possible move if there is no solution found for that move then i un modify the board and continue with the next move in the stack of all possible moves i'm not copying over the board as the write up says so i'm not sure what i can do to make this more efficient can i get some hints for what i should be thinking about to improve efficiency,private,peg

peg,i am sort of confused how to set the the question up or whether i am using the right way of thinking so the base cases for peg question is when there are no longer possible moves in which case i return peg and when there is only peg left in which i return on the recursive case i split up into four possible legal moves that can be made recall the function again with peg after that put the move into the stack and return peg when i went to office hours today i heard whatever was the base case should be called the same in the other recursive calls i am unsure that if i return peg that the number will return the right way that i wanted or am i supposed to return the recursive function itself also i am unsure if i should call solve first and do the moves or do the moves and do the solve if i do the moves and do solve is the only side effect going to be that the order of moves are flipped or is there a bigger difference thank you,private,peg

task,hello i am confused about the relationship between peg solve and solve also peg solve is supposed to return a number and it should have stack of moves according to the writeup but then there is only one move for this task so i am confused when they say stack of moves does it actually mean stack of a move also it says that it is recommended that we have a helper function solve to consider all possible moves that can be made for the board why is that necessary and for what use for task don't they just want us to have a single move and see that if that will work thanks,private,peg
peg solve,for task page says for this task your code should try only one move for each board configuration reaching either a winning configuration i e one peg left or a losing configuration more than one peg left but no moves possible i'm confused what if this is a winnable board that needs more than one moves and the writeup says we should define the function int peg solve board b stack s to attempt a deterministic solution to peg solitaire for the given board does this assume that there's at most one possible move on the given board and should we also modify the board besides pushing the possible move to s if we find one,public,peg

written homework c,may i have a hint on how to draw the stack in question c for the written homework my reasoning is that if the stack should return true for is stack in the beginning that must mean that top and bottom point to correct nodes and all next pointers should point to the correct nodes as well right but in that case even when we start popping elements from the stack there shouldn't be any problems because all the next pointers are correct and x and y will end up correct as well i know that making the prev pointers point to incorrect nodes would make the data structure not well formed but i'm not sure how it would have any effect on the test function or cause any assertion failures there what part of my understanding is wrong,private,written6

question a unspecified,on question of the written homework for the very first node in a linked list when it says a non empty stack has an unspecified prev field does that mean we do not know the type or can we assume it to be null in better context when we are implementing the pop function if we want to change the prev field for the new top can we set this to null or should we be allocating a new list node copy over the data and next fields and leave the prev field to be whatever the default value was or should we not care what the prev value is and assume if anyone decides to backtrack through the list they will check to see that the list node they are on is not equal to the 'top' value before moving on to the 'prev' list node hope that question makes sense thanks,private,written6

general question,on the lecture note on linked lists it says typedef struct list node list struct list node telem data tlist next struct infinite tint x tstruct infinite next and one of them works because it's a recursion occurring beneath a pointer or array type whose values are addresses this allows a finite representation for values of the struct type the latter one does not work because it would require an infinite amount of space i don't understand why the earlier one would work and the latter would not work,private,written6

written question solution,since it is difficult to tell from the rubric what a correct diagram should look like here is a picture of the final state of memory notated according to our conventions there are some common missteps which many people encountered here are some pointers to help you avoid making these missteps be careful with assignments involving pointers consider this example with two pointers a and b int a alloc int int b a b a if we had to translate the assignment last line into english we could say let b be the same thing as a a is a pointer to a memory location containing so b should be a pointer to the same memory location a common misinterpretation is let b point to a note that if that were the case b would be a pointer to a pointer to an int or an int this is incompatible with our declaration of b as an int by double checking the types we can help ourselves not to make this mistake but this is not enough to guarantee that we are correct more on that in a second adding dereferences to the mix can add confusion but we can think of assignment the same way x r means that x the pointer which x points to be the same thing as r i e a pointer to the same location remember that just because our pointers are the same type and point to the same location it does not mean they are the same pointer let's consider again the example of x and r before we make this assignment x and r are separate pointers they exist in different places in memory after the assignment they are still separate pointers but they point to the same location the common misstep is to see that line and conclude that x should be a pointer to r which makes x and r the same pointer in the diagram above we can see how the result of this assignment should look x continues being its own box in memory but points to the same thing as r the same is true of y and p,public,written5

question a,are we allowed to find the bottom of the stack by destructively modifying the stack,public,written5
contracts in interface image interface,in the lecture notes for the contracts in the functions in an interface client side are written as requires precondition' instead of requires precondition as we code in c files is this a rule or does it not matter if we write it as how we code in c files in written hw 's prob a do we assume the fields of the struct image header are int width int height and pixel data oh ignore question please i just remembered that how the structs are made should not be known to the client thank you,private,written5 lectures
is there an else if in c,how would we write if s else if s else in c,public,written5
questions about pointers,i have some questions about poiners if there is a sign on a then a is a pointer to a pointer right i e a x y then is x located in the allocated array if a is a pointer to an int and then we say int b a then is b a pointer to the int that a is pointing to similar to question if a is a pointer to a pointer to an int and then we say int b a then is b a pointer to the pointer that a is pointing to thanks,private,lectures
written question b,in written question b are we supposed to keep the linsearch function intact it would seem to me that one would need to change something about the linsearch function in order to make the overlap function asymptotically faster,private,written5
using binary search in prob b,in written hw prob b can we use binsearch the binary search function assuming that the function is defined just as we use linsearch thank you,private,written5
writt hw prob a,for written hw problem a when we write the big oh notation should we write it in terms of small case n or capital n thanks,private,written5
question,in the correct function for queue size do you have to enqueue everything that you previously dequeued from the original queue or can you just set your old queue equal to the new queue so that they point to the same queue,public,written5
interface vs implementation,can you use img width in the interface for the image type what is the difference between interface and struct,public,written5
pointers,if x points to pointer y which points to if you change the value of y to point to something else does x still point to or wherever y is pointing to,public,written5
written question a,the writeup explicitly states that we can assume p p is that something we need to utilize in our interface or implementation or just something to keep in mind i'm not really sure where that applies to the question when separately getting width and height we need to have an ensures statement is an upper bound necessary is there a good way to determine this bound without accessing the value stored in memory int max works but it's not a tight bound thanks,private,written5
confused interface and implementation,generally i m having a trouble understanding how the code for the interface connects with the code for the implementation and the flow of the code when user interacts with the interface more specifically why does the functions for the interface only contain pre and post conditions example int ssarr len ssarr t a requires a null why isn't there a in the typedef for the implementation interface typedef struct ssarr header ssarr t implementation typedef struct ssarr header ssarr,public,written5
written image interface,for the image interface should we allow images with height width equal to edit nevermind found my answer in the written,public,written5
questions about structs pointers,i have some questions regarding lecture is the star symbol just indicating that the variable is a pointer e g int x alloc int means x is a pointer that points toward an int and x means x is a pointer is typedef arr t a comment we write it so that we can understand what's happening or is it an actual part of the code thanks,private,lectures

citing lecture notes,on a solution for a problem for written i used a single line from the lecture notes verbatim can i just cite the link of the lecture notes next to my solution on my submission,public,written5
data structure invariant question b,regarding question b on written homework i understand that we need a precondition to check that the image is valid before running image getpixel but do we also need a postcondition to check that the image is still valid after running image getpixel if we are not manipulating the data i only ask because the instructions say the implementation must use this specification function to assure that the image is valid before and after any image operation yet in the lecture notes we did not use a postcondition for ssarr get thanks,private,written5
written problem,there doesn't seem to be enough lines for everything i want to write should we include brackets for the functions in the image code because i'm barely squeezing the code into the lines without them thanks never mind i did the question wrong,public,written5

fast parameter for count vocab,i don't seem to understand the point of the fast parameter it says in the written to execute binary search if fast is true and linear search if it's false does that mean that you only use fast when vocab is sorted but isn't that already a precondition for count vocab that vocab is sorted,private,doslingos

stable sorting,yesterday in lecture we classified sorting algorithms based on whether they were fast or slow and based on whether they were processing the array in place i e they did not need to allocate a new array or not another useful property is whether they are stable stability makes sense when you are sorting not just a number but a record e g your itunes collection or student grades let's take that as an example say i have a spreadsheet with your andrew ids and your homework grades most of the time it is sorted by andrew id that makes entering grades faster but after each hw is graded it is useful to sort it by grade so to see who did well and who needs help when i do that what happens to the andrew ids they can remain in the same order for each grade e g the andrew ids of everybody who got are still in order they end up in shuffled thereby losing the order a sorting algorithm that guarantees is stable entries with the same sorting value remain sorted how do the sorting algorithms we examined fare here's a summary fast in place stable selection sortno yes no insertion sortno yes yes merge sort yesno yesquick sortmostlyyesno challenge questions why is selection sort not stable why is merge sort stable why is quick sort not stable,public,lectures challenges

confusion about mask,hi i was confused on how we are suppose to implement the mask in the blur function are we suppose to go through all the values in the pixels array and put the mask centered at that point for all the points in the list or is it suppose to be centered on the image and if we are suppose to place it on every point do we add all the times the mask overlaps that point sorry i'm just very confused on what this function is really suppose to do thanks,public,images
written c,i'm very confused about how exactly to construct a loop invariant that tells us something about hi that proves the postcondition based on my understanding of the function hi is initialized to n and neither hi nor n are modified within the loop or anywhere in the function therefore couldn't we just replace every instance of hi with n and if hi is an arbitrary variable that represents n how can we construct a loop invariant with it that proves the postcondition,private,written3
masking clarification,if we were to send the function a x image array length and a x mask array length we should just get the exact same image out right since there's only one pixel and one mask component the new pixel intensity would be mask value pixel intensity mask value which would yield the initial pixel intensity and thus the original image am i correct,public,images

why we care about style,if you have read through the 'images' programming assignment you noticed that it has a style grading component why are we inflicting this on you isn't that make work what does the computer care about spacing and line breaks anyway style grading has to do with why we write programs there are two main reasons to get a computer to execute the algorithm expressed by the program to communicate algorithms to other people chances are that you have experienced mainly so far many of you wrote only small programs a couple of thousand lines max for which the only developers were you and maybe a friend as opposed to a team and whose usefulness was limited in time for example to solve an assignment as opposed to code used every day by a customer this will change as you get out in the real world some of you may even start to experience this as you go through your major's curriculum you will be working on code bases that are huge e g facebook was million lines of php as of last year you will be working on a small portion of it as part of a team with a variety of specializations this code will likely be around for dozens of years and will be frequently updated to fix bugs and add features in this setting is as important as maybe even more when a primary purpose of code is communicate with other people btw such other person could be yourself in the future you want to write your code in such a way that it is as easy to read and understand as possible in particular use formatting that is easy to the eye long lines are hard to read tabs are interpreted differently by different editors indentation reveals the structure of your code better than braces etc use comments to say what you are doing any time it's not obvious if you spent minutes writing a line it will take you that long to figure out what it does in months write intelligible and intuitive code don't call all your variables x and i don't use obscure constructions macho programmers love to do that but their code is often full of bugs see http www cs cmu edu misc styleguide pdf for a summary of the main best practices if you want to gain an appreciation for the importance of style dust off some program you wrote a year ago or more or even code that a friend wrote if you find yourself staring at the screen very closely and saying 'what the heck' a lot you are experiencing bad style you can ensure that this won't happen about your code in the future by writing code using good styling practices even if all you care about is the here and now tas will be able to help you a lot more if they can immediately understand the code you are asking help about getting cursed at is not a programmers destiny,public,images

clarifications,on c it should say the first loop invariant is always preserved because note that when proving loop invariant preservation you are allowed to assume the invariant holds initially in question we want you to reason logically not operationally even though you can see in the code that something can't operationally happen sometimes there isn't a line you can point to that let's you establish that fact because you need it to be true in all iterations of the loop which is not vocabulary that you have available that is we want you to be able to say that something holds or doesn't hold for every iteration of the loop which requires logical reasoning not operational reasoning we've seen a lot of questions about this in office hours so hopefully that clears a few things up,public,written2

using loop guard in proof of safety,i was wondering whether or not we are allowed to use loop guards to prove safety or if proofs are limited to using only contracts for example on hw c the contracts alone do not guarantee i on line is non negative but if i take into account the loop guard on line then the array allocation on line would never execute in the first place when i equals a value that violates array safety i thanks brandon,private,written2
something wrong with autolab i think,hi i know i shouldn't have started it so late but i've been working on the assignment since pm till the very last minute on task of the puzzle hunt i believe i had passed the post conditions on common prefix and find nonrepeating position but autolab never gave me points for find nonrepeating position in particular i had adjusted my code several ways but kept failing on autolab for aab when i adjusted my function to return and separate times it still gave an error which i find astonishing considering there is a postcondition that result resul string length s i spent so much time debugging these two function i didn't even bother trying the third i guess i should have started before but could we discuss my error later at some point during office hours thanks karan bokil,private,scavhunt
safety with arrays an example,consider the following function that creates and returns an array of perfect squares int squares int n requires n ensures is squares result n int a alloc array int n for int i i n i loop invariant i a i i i return a we need to check for array safety in two places when we allocate the array in line the length argument n must be non negative andwhen we access the array in line the index i must be in range we can say that line is safe because of line we can say that line is safe because of line so i is not negative and lines and the length of the array is n and the loop guard guarantees that i is always less than n it's important to know that all array operations are safe and you can use logical reasoning to help you show safety now let's look at the postcondition how do we know the returned array is really an array of squares as stated in the postcondition on line we can use a recursive specification function to test the final array bool is squares int a int n requires n n length a if n return true return a n n n is squares a n you may observe that the pre condition is more general than needed read on and explain where this is useful how do we prove correctness of the squares function we don't have enough contracts in the squares function to do this so far let's assume the loop invariant is valid for now when the loop terminates exercise show this we know that i n and i by lines and this isn't enough to imply that is squares result n is true we need a stronger loop invariant in order to reason the correctness of the squares function we can modify the loop invariant as follows a loop invariant i b loop invariant i n c loop invariant is squares a i or more compactly loop invariant i i n is squares a i exercise show that this improved loop invariant is valid by showing it is initially true and holds for any arbitrary iteration of the loop hint you might want to convert the for loop to a while loop to make it easier to reason with this new loop invariant in the squares function we now can say that after the loop terminates we know that the loop invariant is true and the loop guard is false i n i i n is squares a i by lines and i i n is squares a i by reductionis squares a n by substitution and safety line is squares result n by line as we move on to more sophisticated problems we will often ask you to reason logically that some function is correct and that specific operations are safe,public,lectures

clarification on safety reasoning,it says on the first page in this week's homework that when we're reasoning about safety for locals modified by the loop the loop guard and loop invariants are the only statements we can use taken literally that would mean that i would not be able to reason using if statements like i might want to for question d on page i'm referring to the if statement on line which checks if variable n is non negative am i interpreting the instructions correctly or are if statements actually ok edit after thinking about it a little more i think it might make sense to argue that because n is inside the if statement and does not get modified between the if statement line and the call line it might be ok to reason that n however i'm still unsure as to whether that line of reasoning is allowed,private,written2

how to use piazza effectively,as many of you may know piazza is a system for asking and answering questions about lectures assignments logistics exams quizzes and anything else related to the course it's typically an extremely useful tool for getting your ideas answered and questions answered when using piazza and asking questions please keep in mind the following guidelines think before you ask the instructors and tas of the course want to help you help yourself make sure to make your questions detailed enough for us to understand the basics of the problem you're having importantly if you need help debugging a problem with code don't just paste the code in a private post and ask what's wrong also please don't post an autolab result and ask for hints we want you to think about the code you write just like in office hours make sure you have isolated the bug to a few functions or parts of your code or a failing test that you've written from there we'll try to help you get unstuck but you may find that you figure it out just by taking steps to write tests and debug especially if the question is one you should be able to answer on your own tas may wait for some time after a post has been made before they respond there are a couple of reasons for this first we want to encourage students to help one another and this gives time for composing a student response second we want you all to learn the art of talking to the duck see http www codinghorror com blog rubber duck problem solving html and thinking through problems on your own make sure to answer your own question delete your question or change the post from a question to a note if you work it out yourself in order to not waste the course staff's time check for redundant questions before asking the question search for it on the bar on the left someone may have already asked it be active in the course both answering and asking that said do ask and answer questions actively one of the best ways to understand concepts is to teach it to others be sure not to just give the direct answer or write fully coded implementations in your answers in fact we will delete answers like these help your classmates think by giving hints without just revealing the answer moreover make as many posts public as possible so they help the maximum number of students the question you asked will most likely be on other people's minds unless the question is personal or involves your own code you should probably make it a public question feel free to mark yourself as anonymous don't reveal answers details of homework assignments piazza is a public forum don't send your code in a public post for everyone to see there are academic integrity issues here see the course website for more info on academic integrity if you definitely need to post source code you've written please make it a private post with just you and the instructors if it's code from lectures or other course materials that everyone can see feel free to post it publicly however if as long as you're not posting code you're not going to get in trouble for helping a fellow student on piazza without getting a fair warning first i mean if someone asks what's the answer to b and you say the answer is we're gonna have a chat but short of that be nice etc go out of your way to make others feel welcome this is both self explanatory and harder than it sounds finally to get the point for task in programming assignment modify your salute function so that salute returns aloha make sure to change the precondition appropriately to account for the fact that is a valid input,public,other
