Carnival homework schedule,"<p>As you are probably aware of, Carnival starts on Thursday April 20th.\xa0 But Thursdays are when programming assignments are typically due.\xa0 In the past, when we kept it that way, we had a lot of unhappy people working on their code while everybody else was having a good time.\xa0 To avoid this, in recent years we have been shifting the schedule a bit.\xa0 Namely, for about 2 weeks starting right after midterm 2, written and programming assignments will be swapped (written hw due on Thursdays and programming hw on Mondays).\xa0 Specifically (major changes are in <strong>bold</strong>):</p> <ul><li>written 10 is due on Monday April 3 (normal schedule)</li><li><em><strong>nothing</strong> is due on <strong>Thursday April 6</strong></em> (the day of midterm 2)</li><li><strong>prog 9</strong> is due on <strong>Monday April 10</strong></li><li><strong>written 11</strong> is due on <strong>Thursday April 13</strong></li><li><strong>prog 10</strong> is due on <strong>Monday April 17</strong></li><li>written 12 is due on Monday April 24 (back to normal schedule)</li><li>prog 11(a) is due on Thursday April 27 (back to normal schedule)</li></ul> <p>After that, the schedule is normal again.</p> <p></p> <p>See the hw schedule on the course web page for details</p> #pin",public,logistics
How to Do Well on Programming Homeworks,"<p>As we move into the last part of the semester, you'll notice that the programming homework assignments are getting longer, more complex, and more difficult. Instead of telling you exactly what to do and how to do it, the programming assignment writeups will focus more on describing the fundamental concepts and expectations behind the assignment. If you\xa0follow these steps, you will probably learn more and do better on these assignments:</p> <p></p> <ol><li><strong>Start early.</strong> While in past weeks you might have been able to complete the programming assignments in a couple days, you\xa0probably will not be able to do this going forward.</li><li><strong>Read the writeup carefully</strong><strong>.\xa0</strong>Don't skip the sections at the beginning and jump to the task descriptions. Don't rely on ""folk wisdom"" from friends and classmates. If you haven't read or don't\xa0understand every\xa0section of\xa0the writeup, you\xa0will have trouble completing the assignment correctly.\xa0If you have a question or are stuck on a task, reread the relevant sections of the writeup first.</li><li><strong>Use the search field on Piazza</strong>. Admittedly, the search\xa0functionality on Piazza isn't the best, but you should be able to get good results by searching for a single keyword.</li><li><strong>Don't forget about the beginning of the course</strong><strong>.</strong> Remember contracts, loop invariants, and correctness proofs? While you might not be able to completely prove that your code is correct, you should be able to reason through your logic and consider\xa0whether the code\xa0you've written makes logical sense. ""Hacking on the code until it works"" is rarely a good strategy for writing correct code.</li></ol> <p></p> <p>#pin</p>",public,ropes|lightsout|c0vm|queues
