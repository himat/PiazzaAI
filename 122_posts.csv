carnival homework schedule,as you are probably aware of carnival starts on thursday april th but thursdays are when programming assignments are typically due in the past when we kept it that way we had a lot of unhappy people working on their code while everybody else was having a good time to avoid this in recent years we have been shifting the schedule a bit namely for about weeks starting right after midterm written and programming assignments will be swapped written hw due on thursdays and programming hw on mondays specifically major changes are in bold written is due on monday april normal schedule nothing is due on thursday april the day of midterm prog is due on monday april written is due on thursday april prog is due on monday april written is due on monday april back to normal schedule prog a is due on thursday april back to normal schedule after that the schedule is normal again see the hw schedule on the course web page for details pin,public,logistics
how to do well on programming homeworks,as we move into the last part of the semester you'll notice that the programming homework assignments are getting longer more complex and more difficult instead of telling you exactly what to do and how to do it the programming assignment writeups will focus more on describing the fundamental concepts and expectations behind the assignment if you follow these steps you will probably learn more and do better on these assignments start early while in past weeks you might have been able to complete the programming assignments in a couple days you probably will not be able to do this going forward read the writeup carefully don't skip the sections at the beginning and jump to the task descriptions don't rely on folk wisdom from friends and classmates if you haven't read or don't understand every section of the writeup you will have trouble completing the assignment correctly if you have a question or are stuck on a task reread the relevant sections of the writeup first use the search field on piazza admittedly the search functionality on piazza isn't the best but you should be able to get good results by searching for a single keyword don't forget about the beginning of the course remember contracts loop invariants and correctness proofs while you might not be able to completely prove that your code is correct you should be able to reason through your logic and consider whether the code you've written makes logical sense hacking on the code until it works is rarely a good strategy for writing correct code pin,public,ropes|lightsout|c0vm|queues

question,hi i have a question about c if we say int a xmalloc sizeof int then could we access a i know that in c the default for int is but in c such operation might cause problems right could you explain it also why couldn't we free a is it because it is not allocated then what does a actually represent i know it is a pointer and is the same as a but how should i understand it thank you so much,private,written12

ht insert fail conditions,autolab gives me the following output for task test board ht grade d add repeated expect assertion failure test failed expected a contract to fail actual outcome your program ran to completion but should have signaled an error or failed a contract hint tests that ht insert fails if you add a struct containing a board already in the table i don't understand this response is ht insert supposed to fail tests when a duplicate is inserted as i read the writeup if ht insert is passed a board which has the same bitvector representation as a board already stored it will call hdict insert which will update the value at whatever the key hashes to and return a pointer to the old board which we then free because it is no longer in use i don't see why ht insert should ever fail as autolab says is it supposed to have a contract failure error on duplicate insertions,private,lightsout

confused about board ht h,so struct board data is defined in board ht h but it isn't included when we compile the program then how would we access the information along with a board my idea of solving the problem is something like this each time you see a new board you record this board together with the steps you took to get to this board in the hash table and once we see a lights out board we return the steps that lead to turning all the lights out i e the 'solution' i'm just confused how we can still do that without being to explicitly accessing the steps which i thought can be an extra field in struct board data honestly i'm a little confused why board ht c can run at all without knowing what struct board data is i think i probably misunderstood something badly could you let me know what it is,public,lightsout

bitvector equal,if we don't know what the implementation of bitvectors are how can we implement bitvector equal edit actually i will make this question more generic so i have passed the autograder with full points for my bitvector but i know that my library interface will only work for my definition of bitvector is it required to have a generic bitvector equal flip get etc functions or can we use bitvector like it works in our hash table and lightsout code edit happy what a time to be alive sterling,public,lightsout
times out on a x but not on a x,i'm a little confused as to why autolab would say that my lightsout would successfully pass a x board but time out for this test test lightsout bitvec is bool arr on boards x txt test failed instead of returning success as expected the autograder timed out after seconds since you already tested for respecting the interface in a previous test testing a x board with alternate bit bitarrays so it should be successfully passing the interface test even if the bitvector is a bool array i'm not sure why it being a bool array would cause it to time out though,private,lightsout

task,from the bottom of page on the writeup the key should be a pointer to the board bitvector of the same struct you'll need to take the address of dat board to get this pointer why do we need to get the address to get this pointer if we have a bitvector key can't we do key dat board instead of key dat board then cast the key to a void when passing it into hdict insert also is there a difference between casting something as hdict value or hdict key vs void the only difference that comes to mind is for clarity if this is the case i assume it is recommend to cast things appropriately with hdict value or hdict key,private,lightsout

bitvector new confusion about numbers,in the write up it says a single bit integer could by the same principle store up to true false values that is what the bit vector implementation that you will be implementing does bit vectors are an abstraction that assists us in eciently manipulating small sequences of bits we'll use these sequences of true false bits to store the on o squares in a lights out board the function bitvector new gives us a fresh bit vector containing only false bits so in my bitvector new i understand that i should return a bit integer with all zeros but which representation should this be in i am wondering if i am overthinking it because if it is like bloom filters just will be a bit integer all in zeros right or should it be in hexa and should i be using something liek x is that even right for c syntax,private,lightsout

written question a,while grading question a on the most recent written homework we came across a lot of common missteps that should be acknowledged corrected if you're still confused about these or any other concepts there are office hours in ghc until pm tonight tues as well as the same location from pm wednesday pm o h are replaced by the review session in rashid auditorium casting a struct pointer before accessing a field the arrow operator which accesses the field of a struct pointer has a higher precedence than casting this means that the expression report x current price first tries to get the current price field of x then casts the result to a report this wouldn't compile as you can't dereference a void in c to fix this issue you need parentheses around the cast report x current price note if you're not sure of the order of operations it's better to be explicit and insert extra parentheses than to guess and get it wrong in the future your code may be read by a programmer maybe even your future self who isn't certain of the precedence of the operators so resolving ambiguity is important another common misstep was to add an extra dereference for example report x current price remember that foo bar is equivalent to foo bar so you don't need a star in addition to the arrow unless you are dereferencing a pointer stored in the struct field minheap vs maxheap in this question although we wanted to keep the n largest price increases you needed a priority function that prioritized smaller price increases in the first while loop we want to remove the report from the priority queue that has the smallest price increase pq rem removes the highest priority element first so your priority function needed to assign highest priority to the smallest price increase note remember that 'higher priority' doesn't imply 'higher value' priority is an abstract notion that you the client define by implementing the priority function which you pass by pointer to pq new why does the priority queue's capacity need to be n this was particularly tricky the reason for this was not because of the unused zeroth index in our heap implementation but because of a particular edge case in the given algorithm since the algorithm specifies that you immediately remove a report whenever the priority queue is full at the end of the loop you end up with at most capacity elements in the priority queue in order to keep the n largest elements you needed to have room to store n elements you could think of the loop body as doing the following add one element to the priority queueif there are n elements drop the smallest so only the n largest remain,public,written10

queue reverse,the writeup says in queue c implement the linear time functions queue peek q i and queue reverse q for our variant implementation of queues note these functions must not allocate memory either directly by calling alloc or indirectly by calling queue new or enq so can we make temporary pointers because when we make pointers we also allocate memory,public,queues

tests for rope reduce,i wrote tests for rope reduce by asserting string equal original string rope tostring rope in array after reduce i tried to create more complex structures by using rope joining and overlapping substrings why might i be passing all my string equal tests and still be passing no correctness tests in autolab does autolab only check for string equal or does it somehow check for pointer equality,private,ropes
is queue,in the writeup it says that the segment length between start and end should be if they are at the same node and start next is null i don't get why that second condition is there what if i have a queue where things are inserted then i move end to point to the same node as start isn't the length of the segment between front and back then so it should be an invalid queue since the size of that queue wouldn't be,public,queues
rope join,i am a little confused on the specifics of rope join i know that if one rope is null and the other is a leaf rope join should still be able to be implemented and produce a valid rope however what if one rope is null and the other is a leaf with data a for example we are not allowed to make the null rope a leaf with the empty string because of the definition of leaf from the writeup must have string length and we cannot share characters from the other leaf because it only has string length of in this case can we just return a single leaf instead of a concatenation node or do we have to return a concatenation node,private,ropes

stuck on rope sub,i've been stuck on rope sub for the longest time i just can't figure out how to even start i followed the suggestion that the writeup has and figured out the ones that will just need to simply return without any new allocation but i am not sure how to think about the implementation suppose i go all the way down to the leftmost leaf then i would i not be able to go back up and see if there is a higher up concat rope that i can use in general how should i go about this,private,ropes
rope charat,i'm assuming if we are allowed to use string charat that worst case if it had no concatenation nodes you would just use string charat on the data however in the library it says that string charat is n and you were looking for logn is there another way to approach this question,public,ropes
contract purity,hi for my is rope function i created a simple linked list to check for circularity there is an error because my function to check for circularity modifies previously allocated memory the linked list struct which i allocated in the main body of is rope i didn't know that contracts can't allocate their own local memory i was wondering if autoab will be checking for purity because in that case i will have to completely change how i'm checking for circularity unless there's another way around the issue thanks it works if i use no purity check,public,ropes
function pointers qeustion,why is it that if we define a function pointer such as typedef bool key equiv fn key x key y as is implemented in ropes the function that we actually create is named bool key equiv key x key y without the fn i would think that this would be a problem because the names don't match up but obviously it is legit is it that the function is defined by the parameters and return type rather than by the name that it is given,public,lectures|ropes

hash functions,i just realized after submitting my th submission that task specifies that i must compute the hash index from the hashvalue by modding by the size of the table and then taking the absolute value will i lose points if i did this in reverse take the absolute value of the hash value and then mod by the size of the table,public,bloom
hash functions do not compile,hi my hash functions are not compiling even though i called them hash hash and hash can you please tell me why thanks,private,bloom

get bit and set bit accept all in range inputs error,hi for the autolab tests of my get bit set bit code i get the error test failed expected successful execution actual outcome an assertion failed unexpectedlyhint get bit and set bit accept all in range inputs however no error crops up in my own testing if possible can you please offer some advise how to go about diagnosing this problem,public,bloom
error on autolab,i am getting this error on autolab test bloom design emptyadd expect successful execution test failed expected successful execution actual outcome the program when run produced the wrong answer hint make sure your hash mul algorithm accepts the empty string and hashes it to but i tested my hash mul function and it does indeed return when i input the empty string what could be the error then,private,bloom
problem c,chain remove from chain chain p key k tif key equiv elem key p data k t treturn p next t else t tp next remove from chain p next k t treturn p t i think that the result should never be null because in the require statement of ht remove function it says is ht h ht lookup h k null so if under any circumstance remove from chain can find an element then the return value should not be null i'm not sure if i have misunderstood anything,private,written8
question c,in c of written how do we ensure that the elements are printed in one line do we need to use string join or can we assume that elem print is implemented such that anything printed after calling it will be on the same line as well,public,written9
written grading dispute,i am just wondering why we have to check null in the recursive function remove from chain as long as the precondition in ht remove is satisfied we are supposed to be able to find the elem inside the chain as we call the function recursively so the chain cannot be null at the very beginning so we will never move past the end of the chain also the it ht h guarantees that the chain is valid so i don't think it is necessary to check whether the chain is null in the remove from chain,private,written8
weird thing is happening,my performance score for bloom for both my own test and the autograder is consistently i thought it was just my hash function at first but now i'm starting to feel like it's too much of a coincidence is it possible for my bloom to not be working correctly as according to the writeup but still compile every time and pass the autograder's compilation execution tests edit i think it isn't working correctly because it seems to stop passing tests once i make a nd or more new bloom so the first new bloom works but not beyond that i can't figure out why though edit again i'm so sorry i meant bloom add and for everything,public,bloom

data array wrong size,autolab said my data array was the wrong size so i was wondering if that has to do with having tables with a size less than in bloom c i made the size of int data in that case since only one number is needed to fit all of the boolean values is this incorrect should i make the size of data n instead,private,bloom
task length of array,for get bit and set bit i can be between and length of array but the hash value from my hash functions can technically be any number how do i limit my hash values to be in the range that the array supports,public,bloom

performance tests,from the ungraded autolab tests for bloom filter it seems that my tests are overly punishing the meh filters and under punishing the bad filters while it seems to be on par for the ok filters i am not too sure why how this can be could this have to do with load factors any advice on how why my tests may be doing this would be helpful,private,bloom
is bloom precondition,i'm trying to check if length b data b limit first i used an requires statement but that didn't work because i dereferenced b before i checked if it was null and i can't make an requires b null statement because i have to return a false value for that then i tried adding an assert statement within my function implementation but that didn't work because the program just aborts if the lengths aren't equal since the contracts themselves don't return boolean values isn't it not possible to return false using contracts in that case how do i check if the lengths are equal should i just use an ensures statement,private,bloom

hash function for empty string,do our hash functions need to work for empty strings the way my function is set up the array goes out of index in the presence of empty strings,public,bloom
bloom new,the writeup says that calling bloom new with n would create an array of n integers and this would be bigger than the requested size however if we call bloom new with doesnt that means the integer array will be size if we make the array size aren't we supposed to add to the size to get the bigger property,public,bloom

blotched avl rotation example in class,earlier in class the example i had in my notes of where a single rotation is not sufficient to restore the height invariant in an avl tree after an insert did not work out here's an actual example consider the avl tree and let's insert t' ok we have a height invariant violation indicated with and what happens if we rotate the tree right at this doesn't work we still have a violation and doing a left rotation on will get us back to the previous tree we need to carry out a double rotation which amounts to first doing a left rotation at in the original tree t' and then a right rotation at let's do it in steps rotate left at note that this is a node below the first violation rotate right at now we are back to a tree that respects the height invariant a valid avl tree when to use each rotation single rotation when the imbalance occurs in an outer subtree i e and the symmetric case double rotation when the imbalance occurs in an inner subtreeand the symmetric case you can see how it all works out with generic tree on the slides posted on the course web site http www cs cmu edu misc avl pdf and done in slightly different way on the lecture notes for the avl lecture if you want to see how insertion works on concrete avl trees there are a number of animations on the web for example http www cs usfca edu galles visualization avltree html if you want to try it out yourself in code see the c implementation available on the course web site,public,lectures

written grading bug,we discovered a grading issue in task c of written the rubric assumed each chain in the hash table h could contain multiple elements with the same key only the first one of which would be returned by ht lookup but the precondition is ht h prevented that as a result some people got point deducted for not removing all elements with that key in the chain first argument of remove from chain we fixed this by changing the weight of the rubric item removes current element iff key is k from points to pointremoving the incorrect rubric item removes all elements with key k consequently the people above are now getting an additional pt this is already reflected in the grade forecaster sorry for the inconvenience,public,written8

clarification on bloom size,the writeup says bloom new n creates a bloom filter whose data field is an array of n integers wouldn't you end up with an effective table size smaller than or equal to the requested table size and if n is less than wouldn't it try to make an array of length it should really be an array of n integers right on autolab i keep failing the last test with the hint hint bloom new creates bloom t with the requested limit which seems to me like it's saying bloom new n should create a bloom filter with a data field of an array of n integers effectively n bools instead,public,bloom

bloom tests,what i am planning to do for the bloom test is first check that interfaces were not violated if all the valid interface tests were passed try to keep track of false positives or just trues and compare with load factor to give a performance score am i on the right track or am i thinking this wrong also should i be checking for interface breakdowns such as when i try to make a bloom filter with an illegal table length does it actually make one if so how would i be checking that because i thought we could not make on purpose something not respecting the interface i think we did that in the linked list test making lab are there any suggestions for me to think about dealing with the test cases,private,bloom

how is going now with responses and comments,we have put together a brief survey to get a better sense of how things are going from your perspective this will help us correct any issues for the rest of the term and improve future editions the survey is anonymous so please feel free to speak your mind you can find it at https www surveymonkey com r llplnnn the survey will close on next sunday night march disclaimer there are a few things we won't be able to change namely the topics covers and the expectations in terms of homework exams those were set by the people who designed the course survey outcomes first thank to all of those who took the time to fill the survey this input is really valuable for making better in fact without feedback from you we would not be able to know of certain things that need to get fixed below is a summary of responses with some comments in italics what worked well in no particular order programming hw lectures labs office hours recitations piazza bonus tas gradescope instructors written hw given that this is pretty much all we do it looks like everybody found something good in the course although not everybody the same thing what should be done better pretty much the same things that other said worked well minus piazza and gradescope this means everybody found something that can be improved participation points more quizzes lab points points for recitation you shouldn't worry too much a historically the vast majority of the class got the full by the end of the semester b there will be plenty more opportunities to earn participation points c it's a tiny fraction of the total score for the course go over quizzes in class sure why not assess how many students earn the rd lab point and call it a bonus point how many students got points in lab varied a lot throughout the semester from a low of to a high of with an average of while this is fairly normal we monitor the trends and make adjustments to labs to keep it more predictable if that helps you are free to view it as a bonus point written and programming hw are hard compared to what is covered in class of course the lectures are meant to introduce building blocks and basic concepts and do so in the limited time we have available assignments are meant to explore them further by combining them in sophisticated ways lectures and lecture notes are not an exact match the two are very close but indeed there are some differences one the one hand we do want to expose you to different ways to approach the same concept simply because different approaches resonate differently with different students use the one that best helps you learn on the other hand lectures are where we experiment with new ways to present some concepts and if they work we later incorporate them into the lecture notes make more like sorry you graduated from that one already don't force us to go to specific lectures we are college students blame or thank the fire marshal not us by law we are not allowed to fit more people than the official capacity of a room regulating attendance is one way to make sure people don't show up to the lecture labs recitations that are late in the day written programming assignments are unclear while this is not intentional you will see that as you progress through your studies assignments will have less and less precise instructions one reason is that as things get more complex it is harder to spell everything out a second reason is that the parts that are not fully spelled out can generally be inferred from the context or from what you have done so far the most important reason though is that very little is fully spelled out in real life and that's what we are preparing you for in part keep the best autolab submission rather than the last one no objection to that but autolab does not support it and doing so manually would require many more resources than we have available how is the pace of the course too fast a bit fast just right a bit slow too slow any additional comments various expressions of love or dislike for this and that more practice problems there are a few at the end of the notes for each lectures and we will adding more we can also give some at the end of class more bonus problems we are trying to find the right balance weaker students tend to find lots of bonus problems demoralizing while stronger students love them some general comments there are a few things mentioned above that we cannot change as individual instructors these include the topics covered by the course and the performance expectations to pass the class this impacts the kind and difficulty of the assignments and the pace of the course said this the overall group of instructors not just the ones you see review the course periodically and we are taking into account your feedback there are also some things we will not change because based on past experience they lead to reduced learning and lower performance overall these include a few things that some of you find unpalatable like the very notion of a participation grade even if ours is a small one having written and programming assignment as separate hw and the collaboration policy finally there are the logistical challenges of managing one of the largest course on campus was the largest class on campus last fall i haven't heard about this spring yet many of our policies and procedures are dictated by this heavy use of automation strict rules rare exceptions etc we don't have the luxury of being as accommodating as some of the other classes you have taken or are taking simply because we don't have the resources to do so or we would have to significantly lower what you are getting out of this class which we can't do,public,other

questions,hi i have a few questions the first one is that when i write the row and col fields in is editor i try to use the tbuf row and tbuf col function to get the result and then compare the result with the current e row and col however when i compile it it says editor c note function 'tbuf row' must be pure because it is called on previously allocated state from here if e row tbuf row e buffer e col tbuf col e buffer tbuf c error function may assign to previously allocated memory b cursor temp tbuf c error function may assign to previously allocated memory b cursor b cursor prev tbuf c error function may assign to previously allocated memory b cursor temp tbuf c error function may assign to previously allocated memory b cursor temp tbuf c error function may assign to previously allocated memory b cursor b cursor prev tbuf c error function may assign to previously allocated memory b cursor temp tbuf c error function may assign to previously allocated memory b cursor temp tbuf c error function may assign to previously allocated memory b cursor temp tbuf c error function may assign to previously allocated memory b cursor b cursor prev tbuf c error function may assign to previously allocated memory b cursor temp editor c note function 'tbuf col' must be pure because it is called on previously allocated state from here if e row tbuf row e buffer e col tbuf col e buffer i do not understand why i also used tbuf row in the other editor functions and they could work in tbuf well why does only this is editor one get wrong also when i test tbuf row and col function i think i did get the correct answer but in autolab it just told me i got it wrong i played with my editor and tbuf but all of them work well i tried lots of input and i think all of them have good position value and good operation could you give me some hints about it the last one is that in the write up it says that the editor function should not change buffer even if the current operation is not valid for example even the cursor is at the leftmost position if we call editor backward it should not raise errors so i used if condition instead of contract to rule the invalid cases out so if there is a bad position my function will do nothing but in the test case in autolab it requires me to fail a contract under bad location it seems that it is self conflicting so the editor just want us to call tbuf function also we need to update the row and col values of the e and in this process we should not use the tbuf row function but could use tbuf col function right i spent almost hours on this homework but still could not figure out what is wrong also do you have office hour today so that i could ask some questions thank you so much and sorry for the poor description,private,tbuf

tokens example from recitation,i'm still a little unclear about how the tokens model works for the example we did in recitation today where we incremented the limit by instead of so say we had an array that was then we add in a and and our amortized cost is tokens for each to do so now we resize and we spend a token to copy each element over now we have tokens saved up now say we want to add in some new elements and so now we have spent those tokens and then we spend more now when we copy into a new array we get but now we have tokens left over we can then spend those four tokens for writing each new one and we have one more saved so instead of paying tokens we can now spend only tokens across the whole so now we have spent tokens i thought that the whole point was that we were supposed to spend an amortized cost of tokens each time,private,lectures

question c,for the blanks in lines i am a bit confused on how this binary search would work for some specific examples for array a where x and n if i put the conditional on line as a mid x and the assert statement on line as a mid x on the first iteration mid would be a which is x so lo mid but that would mean that the loop would continue to search from indices to hi which disregards the fact that a mid x if i instead switch where the equals goes to so the conditional on line would instead be a mid x and the assert statement on line would be a mid x for array a where x and n on the first iteration of the loop mid would be a which is not x so the loop would go to the else statement the assert statement verifies that a x so hi mid but that would mean that the loop would continue to search from indices to which wouldn't find the last occurrence which is in the part of the array from indices to i can't quite understand how to find the last occurrence of x in these cases with the given statements that follow the conditionals in the loop,private,written4

questions about written,for proving big o in question c i was trying to follow the definition of big o that we went over in class and in recitation however i remember that we did not define c and n from the beginning and the definition also says that there exist some c and n on the other hand i also took this course last semester and i remembering talking with the ta over my regrade issues because i got points off for not setting the c and n values initially but rather meddling with the two functions first to calculate an appropriate value for the two variables but this was the method we did in recitation so i'm very confused what to follow right now what exactly should the order for proving big o be for question b instruction tells me to prove that when the code returns on line the postconditions on line always evaluates to true however from my knowledge line for would return false and the rest true thus f t t t would evaluate to true am i getting on the wrong track if i am right should i also be proving that the postcondition on line will return false thanks,private,written4

stable sorting,in lecture we classified sorting algorithms based on whether they were fast or slow and based on whether they were processing the array in place i e they did not need to allocate a new array or not another useful property is whether they are stable stability makes sense when you are sorting not just a number but a record e g your itunes collection or student grades let's take that as an example say i have a spreadsheet with your andrew ids and your homework grades most of the time it is sorted by andrew id that makes entering grades faster but after each hw is graded it is useful to sort it by grade so to see who did well and who needs help when i do that what happens to the andrew ids they can remain in the same order for each grade e g the andrew ids of everybody who got are still in order they end up in shuffled thereby losing the order a sorting algorithm that guarantees is stable entries with the same sorting value remain sorted how do the sorting algorithms we examined fare here's a summary fast in place stable selection sortno yes yes insertion sortno yes yes merge sort yesno yesquick sortmostlyyesno challenge questions what does find min need to guarantee for selection sort to be stable what needs to be guaranteed for merge sort to be stable why is quick sort not stable,public,lectures

images is valid imagesize,hi i'm working on writing the preconditions described in the imageutil c file copied here checks whether width and height are valid dimensions to be valid dimensions width and height must be strictly positive and multiplying width height must not cause overflow according to the c tutorial page on ints there are only two cases for overflow dividing or modding the minimal integer by although wouldn't multiplying int min by also cause overflow if my first precondition makes sure that width and height then wouldn't width height never cause overflow because they would never be int min or so the only precondition needed is width and height and the overflow one described is redundant edit i realized the function is already written so no preconditions necessary so i guess my edited question is about the line here width int max height why is width height int max required since c tutorial says multiplication will never overflow and is there a reason that int max height is on the right instead of writing width height int max or is that stylistic,private,images

three questions,when we are reasoning over the postconditions loop invariants and loop guards are all the information that we can rely on right on page of lecture note why it says if we exit from the loop because a i x we also know that a i x so x cannot be in the array since it is sorted btw a i x written inside the loop if loop guards and loop invariants are all the information that we can rely on does it mean that we can deduce the loop invariants based on the postconditions the concept of operational reasoning is frequently mentioned in this course but i still cannot tell a clear difference between it and logical reasoning what is the difference between them is there any perfect example to illustrate the difference ensures require the variable to be unchanged by the function does requires also have the same requirement,private,other

get alpha is returning,all other functions work but get alpha is returning instead of the input value i also cannot declare the int it is stored in as a unsigned my guess is that since it is signed the last bit of the is a sign of whether it is positive or negative thus a bit integer is overflow and wraps around to be a negative number,private,pixels

tips on reasoning about code,a common question among students each semester is can i use to justify this statement what kind of statements am i allowed to make this post is an attempt to clarify how we reason about code and structure our proofs in there are two kinds of reasoning that we use in logical reasoning and operational reasoning logical reasoning is using what we know to be true to prove certain properties about code operational reasoning is drawing conclusions about how things change when certain lines of code are run probably the best way to see the difference between these two types of reasoning is with examples when we say things like this we're using logical reasoning we know x from the loop guard y is not modified in the loop on line we know z because we must have entered an if z statement but when we say things like this we're using operational reasoning after an iteration of the loop i' i x is strictly decreasing we know x because x by the loop guard and x x by line it's a common misconception that operational reasoning is always bad and should never be used in fact operational reasoning is often necessary to prove the correctness of functions however operational reasoning is more difficult and prone to error than logical reasoning since you need to consider all of the possible effects any statement could have because of this we want to limit our use of operational reasoning to the smallest chunks of code possible in particular it's very difficult to reason about multiple iterations of a loop at once so you should never make statements like the loop runs y times and x initially so x y when the loop exits in operational reasoning should only be used to prove preservation of loop invariants and loop termination finally to clarify an important point for written an assertion is supported if we can prove it's always true using only logical reasoning,public,written2|written3|lectures

enrollment homework and more,if you are reading this you have successfully enrolled in piazza congratulations as said in class we use autolab and gradescope for homework distribution and submission if you were on the roster of this class minutes ago you are now registered on autolab that's where the writeups for all assignments labs and recitations will be posted and where you submit programming assignments you need to self register on gradescope that's where written hw gets submitted to do so go to https gradescope com and sign up using your andrew address no gmail or other email addresses and entry code b these instructions are also part of the setup lab written homework is now posted you can get started it is due next monday at pm in the future we won't use piazza to announce when new hw are posted they come up automatically as per the table on the course web page http cs cmu edu i forgot to mention in class why we have so many assignments written and programming each week most weeks sounds crazy in the distant past they used to be combined as one assignment due each week what happened was that some well many students spent most of their time on the programming part and did what they could on the written part in the minutes before the deadline bad for learning and bad for grades that's why we decided to split them and have different deadlines we observe that the most successful students do them at the same time going back and forth between written and programming and of course they start well ahead of the deadline good luck in and if you have questions come talk to us,public,logistics|other

how to use piazza effectively,as many of you may know piazza is a system for asking and answering questions about lectures assignments logistics exams quizzes and anything else related to the course it's typically an extremely useful tool for getting your ideas answered and questions answered when using piazza and asking questions please keep in mind the following guidelines think before you ask the instructors and tas of the course want to help you help yourself make sure to make your questions detailed enough for us to understand the basics of the problem you're having importantly if you need help debugging a problem with code don't just paste the code in a private post and ask what's wrong also please don't post an autolab result and ask for hints we want you to think about the code you write just like in office hours make sure you have isolated the bug to a few functions or parts of your code or a failing test that you've written from there we'll try to help you get unstuck but you may find that you figure it out just by taking steps to write tests and debug especially if the question is one you should be able to answer on your own tas may wait for some time after a post has been made before they respond there are a couple of reasons for this first we want to encourage students to help one another and this gives time for composing a student response second we want you all to learn the art of talking to the duck see http www codinghorror com blog rubber duck problem solving html and thinking through problems on your own make sure to answer your own question delete your question or change the post from a question to a note if you work it out yourself in order to not waste the course staff's time check for redundant questions before asking the question search for it on the bar on the left someone may have already asked it be active in the course both answering and asking that said do ask and answer questions actively one of the best ways to understand concepts is to teach it to others be sure not to just give the direct answer or write fully coded implementations in your answers in fact we will delete answers like these help your classmates think by giving hints without just revealing the answer moreover make as many posts public as possible so they help the maximum number of students the question you asked will most likely be on other people's minds unless the question is personal or involves your own code you should probably make it a public question feel free to mark yourself as anonymous don't reveal answers details of homework assignments piazza is a public forum don't send your code in a public post for everyone to see there are academic integrity issues here see the course website for more info on academic integrity if you definitely need to post source code you've written please make it a private post with just you and the instructors if it's code from lectures or other course materials that everyone can see feel free to post it publicly however if as long as you're not posting code you're not going to get in trouble for helping a fellow student on piazza without getting a fair warning first i mean if someone asks what's the answer to b and you say the answer is we're gonna have a chat but short of that be nice etc go out of your way to make others feel welcome this is both self explanatory and harder than it sounds finally to get the point for task in programming assignment modify your salute function so that salute returns aloha make sure to change the precondition appropriately to account for the fact that is a valid input,public,other
