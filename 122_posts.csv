However, there is no hash function or eq function or free function that we need to take as arguments when calling the hdict_new function in hdict.h. Since we could not include .c file, could we just copy these 3 functions from the hdict.c file to our board-ht.c file and use them? Also, what does static inline mean?\xa0</p><p></p><p>Thank you very much!</p><p></p><p>Best,</p>",lightsout

Question about basic ideas of the bit vector,"<p>Hi</p><p></p><p>I have a question about the Bit vectors. I understand that the bit vector is an unsigned 32-bit integer and thus could save 32 true/false value. But what is BITVECTOR_LIMIT? Is it the number of bits of the bit vector?It says we will set the constant bitvector_limit to either 8 or 32. But the board is a square, shouldn't the limit be a perfect square number, like 25 in our h file? I also noticed that in Task3, it says we could use a larger or smaller unsigned integer type. What does it mean? If it is 7 bit vector, how could we get a good board? I am just confused with the relationship between the BITVECTOR_LIMIT and the bit vector and the relation between the size of the board and the BITVECTOR_LIMIT.</p><p></p><p>So confused.</p><p></p><p>Thank you so much!!!!</p><p></p><p>Best.</p>",lightsout

Questions,"<p>Hi\xa0</p><p></p><p>I have some questions.</p><p></p><p>1. Where should I put my typedef. In this problem, we have 2 typedef. One is about queue_t, which is also in queue.h, so we do not need to care about it since we just include queue.h file. Second is the list type. I do not know where I should put it. I tried putting it in queue.c but then in the test file it shows that ""unknown type name  <b>list</b> "" and "" <b>list</b>  undeclared"". Since we could not include\xa0.c file, how could I let the test file know what list type is?</p><p></p><p>2. The second problem is about the queue-use.c1. I read posts about it but I am still confused. We do not have to convert it to c but what if we need it in our test file? If I tried to call these functions in my test file, where should I put these functions? in the test file itself?</p><p></p><p>3. The third question is about the xmalloc and xcalloc. Should it return void* or the pointer to the argument type? Like, \xa0int *x = xmalloc(sizeof(int)), the right hand side return an int* or a void*? \xa0</p><p></p><p>4. In the free function. So we should check whether the function pointer is NULL. If it is NULL, what do you mean by freeing its internal data structures? I am confused with what the internal structure mean? Should I free the queue itself if the function pointer is NULL? If the function pointer is not NULL, then should we free all the data in all the nodes and then free the queue itself?

Written 10 Question 3.1 (a),"<p>While grading question 3.1 (a) on the most recent written homework, we came across a lot of common missteps\xa0that should be acknowledged/corrected:</p><p></p><p>If you're still confused about these or any other concepts, there are office hours in GHC 4307 until 10 pm tonight (Tues)\xa0as well as the same location from 8 - 10 pm Wednesday. (6-8pm O.H. are replaced by the review session, in Rashid Auditorium)</p><p></p><p><strong>Casting a struct pointer before accessing a field</strong></p><p>The arrow operator (<tt>-></tt>), which accesses the field of a struct pointer, has a higher precedence than casting. This means that the expression\xa0<tt>(report*)x->current_price</tt>\xa0first tries to get the current_price field of x, then casts the result to a\xa0<tt>report*</tt>. This wouldn't compile, as you can't dereference a <tt>void*</tt> in c0.</p><p>To fix this issue, you need parentheses around the cast:</p><pre>((report*)x)->current_price</pre><p><em>Note</em>: if you're not sure of the order of operations, it's better to be explicit and insert extra parentheses\xa0than to guess and get it wrong. In the future, your code may be read by a programmer (maybe even your future self) who isn't certain of the precedence of the operators, so resolving ambiguity is important.</p><p></p><p>Another common misstep was to add an extra dereference, for example <tt>(*(report*)x)->current_price</tt>. Remember that\xa0<tt>foo->bar</tt> is equivalent to <tt>(*foo).bar</tt>, so you don't need a star in addition to the arrow, unless you are dereferencing a pointer stored in the struct field.</p><p></p><p><strong>Minheap vs. Maxheap</strong></p><p>In this question, although we wanted to keep the n largest price increases, you needed a priority function that prioritized smaller price increases. In the first while loop, we want to remove the report from the priority queue that has the smallest price increase. <tt>pq_rem</tt> removes the <em>highest priority element first</em>, so your priority function needed to assign highest priority to the smallest price increase.</p><p><em>Note</em>: Remember that 'higher priority' doesn't imply 'higher value' - priority is an abstract notion that you (the client) define\xa0by implementing the priority function\xa0which you pass by pointer to <tt>pq_new</tt>.</p><p></p><p><strong>Why does the priority queue's capacity need to be n + 1?</strong></p><p>This was particularly tricky. The reason for this was **<em>NOT** because of the unused zeroth index in our heap implementation</em>, but because of a particular edge case in the given algorithm. Since the algorithm specifies that you immediately remove a report whenever the priority queue is full, at the end of the loop you end up with at most (capacity - 1) elements in the priority queue. In order to keep the n largest elements, you needed to have room to store n + 1 elements. You could think of the loop body as doing the following:</p><ol><li>add one element to the priority queue</li><li>if there are n + 1 elements, drop the smallest so only the\xa0n largest remain.</li></ol>",written10

So I used if condition instead of contract to rule the invalid cases out. So if there is a bad position, my function will do nothing. But in the test case in autolab, it requires me to fail a contract under bad location. It seems that it is self-conflicting.

Written 4 Problem 3 (c) Rubric/Common Mistakes,"<p><em><strong>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE SUBMITTING A REGRADE REQUEST FOR PROBLEM 3 (C)</strong></em></p><p></p><p>While grading Problem 3 (c), we realized that the rubric items on gradescope did not fully cover all of the possible combinations of code that could arise in responses, so we were forced to make certain (somewhat hidden) changes to how we were grading Problem 3 (c) based on the loop invariants. Therefore, we decided to post a general outline of how we graded this problem.</p><ul><li>Point 2 on the gradescope rubric is\xa0received either if Point 1 was received AND the postcondition given was safe or if Point 1 was not received AND there was an explicit check of safety of array accesses in the postcondition. Note that this means that if no array access was made in the postcondition and you did not receive point 1 it is impossible to receive points for point 2.</li><li>Point 7 on the gradescope rubric is\xa0received either if Point 6\xa0was received AND the postcondition given was safe or if Point 6 was not received AND there was an explicit check of safety of array accesses in the postcondition. Note that this means that if no array access was made in the postcondition and you did not receive point 6\xa0it is impossible to receive points for point 7.</li><li>The correct loop invariants were anything equivalent to ge_seg(x, A, 0, lo) and lt_seg(x, A, hi, n). If you had something different, this changed how exactly we graded the rest of the problem. Specifically<ul><li>If the loop invariants were too weak (for instance, using ge_seg(x, A, 0, lo) and le_seg(x, A, hi, n), there was a 0.25 point deduction applied to the problem, and no credit could be given for Point 6 on the Gradescope rubric.\xa0</li><li>If the loop invariants were unsafe, syntactically incorrect, self-contradictory or impossible to satisfy, no credit was given for points 3-6\xa0<em>regardless of if they matched the rubric</em>.</li><li>If the loop invariants were something else, they were handled on a case by case basis. In general though,\xa0we graded points 4-7 in context of the loop invariants. It was possible for points 4/6 to be exactly what was written on the rubric, but not to receive points due to them not making sense in context of the loop invariants</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Some Mistakes to avoid (Some were common)</strong></p><ul><li>Some people used \\length(A) instead of n in the postcondition. Be careful doing this, as in many cases this could result in an incorrect postcondition. For instance, consider the below\xa0array, where x = 15122 and n = 3. If our postcondition was ... && (\\result == \\length(A)-1 || A[\\result + 1] > x. In that case, a result of 2 is the correct answer, but would violate the ensures statement! (A[result + 1] < x)</li></ul><table width=""717"" height=""36"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""6px"" border=""1""><tbody><tr><td>10000</td><td>10100</td><td>15122</td><td>10100</td><td>10000</td></tr></tbody></table><ul></ul><ul><li>A lot of people missed Point 5 because of an incorrect negation. Be careful - !(A && B) $$\eq$$ !A. Instead, !(A && B) = !A || !B.</li><li>If your code barely fits (or doesn't fit) in the space provided, it likely is overly complicated. Make your TAs happy, and increase your chances at getting a point, by simplifying your code!<ul><li>This goes for your proofs as well</li></ul></li><li>Test your code! A lot of people could have avoided missed points if they just tried it out to see if it worked</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>This will likely be the only time we will post the full rubric/common mistakes for any homework</p><p></p>",written4

Style Question (White Space),"<p>Whitespace - Don t make your code terribly cramped up so that it s hard to read.

"Written 1d, can we manipulate n?","<p>For problem 1d in Written Homework 4, the base case scenario would occur if n = 0, meaning that nothing would need to be checked, leading to a complexity of O(1).

Questions about Written 4,"<p>1. For proving Big-O in Question 1-C), I was trying to follow the definition of Big-O that we went over in class and in recitation. However, I remember that we did not define c and n0 from the beginning and the definition also says that there exist ""some c and n0"". On the other hand, I also took this course last semester and I remembering talking with the TA over my regrade issues because I got points off for not setting the c and n0 values initially but rather meddling with the two functions first to calculate an appropriate value for the two variables. But this was the method we did in recitation -- so I'm very confused what to follow right now. What exactly should the order for proving Big-O be?</p><p></p><p>2. For Question 2-B), instruction tells me to prove that when the code returns on line 18, the postconditions on line 4-7 always evaluates to true. However, from my knowledge, line for would return False and the rest True. Thus F||T&&T&&T would evaluate to true. Am I getting on the wrong track? If I am right should I also be proving that the postcondition on line 4 will return False?</p><p></p><p>Thanks!</p>",written4

Loop invariant preservation,"<p>I am wondering whether exiting a loop because of return statements would violate the preservation of loop invariant. By definition, a loop invariant is supposed to hold before and after the loop iteration and I think it is inappropriate for a loop to have return statements inside because that could lead to safety issues since the loop does not exit appropriately. (Does not exit because the loop guards evaluate to false). Therefore, we cannot guarantee anything about the postcondition anymore. (NOT loop guard AND loop invariants).</p><p></p><p>This question is related to Written 3(a),3(b).

I get that one's for the client to use, but fundamentally what's the difference? It seems like the abstract type is defined using the concrete type, so from what I understand that means a pixel is an int, and a pixel_t is a pixel which is an int. Is that correct?</p><p>2. Does that mean in the functions with pixel p argument that it's just requiring a 32-bit integer? How is that different from just requiring an int?</p><p>3. I'm assuming we put together a pixel based on the four helper functions, does that mean to piece together the integer using the four helpers?</p><p>4. How does an ""interface"" fit into all of this?

Tips on Reasoning about Code,"<p>A common question among students each semester is ""Can I use -------- to justify this statement? What kind of statements am I allowed to make?"" This post is an attempt to clarify how we reason about code and structure our proofs in 15-122.<br /><br />There are two kinds of reasoning that we use in 15-122: logical reasoning and operational reasoning.</p><p></p><blockquote><p><i>Logical reasoning</i> is using what we know to be <strong>true</strong> to prove certain properties about code.<br /><em>Operational reasoning</em> is drawing conclusions about how things <strong>change</strong> when certain lines of code are run.</p></blockquote><p>Probably the best way to see the difference between these two types of reasoning is with examples. When we say things like this, we're using logical reasoning:</p><ul><li>""we know <tt>x > 0</tt> from the loop guard""</li><li>""<tt>y</tt> is not modified in the loop""</li><li>""on line 5, we know <tt>z % 4 == 0</tt> because\xa0we must have entered an <tt>if (z % 4 == 0) {...}</tt> statement""</li></ul><p></p><p>But when we say things like this, we're using operational reasoning:</p><ul><li>""after an iteration of the loop, <tt>i' = i - 1</tt>""</li><li>""<tt>x</tt> is strictly decreasing""</li><li>""we know\xa0x<tt> <\xa00</tt> because <tt>x > 0</tt> by the loop guard and\xa0<tt>x = -x</tt> by line 5""</li></ul><p></p><p>It's a common misconception that operational reasoning is always bad and should never be used. In fact, operational reasoning is often necessary to prove the correctness of functions. However, operational reasoning is more difficult and prone to error than logical reasoning, since you need to consider all of the possible effects any statement could have.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, we want to <strong>limit our use of operational reasoning to the smallest chunks of code possible</strong>. In particular, it's very difficult to reason about multiple iterations of a loop at once, so you should <strong>never</strong> make statements like ""the loop runs <tt>y</tt>\xa0times and <tt>x=0</tt> initially, so <tt>x=y</tt>\xa0when the loop exits."" In 15-122, operational reasoning should only be used to prove preservation of loop invariants and loop termination.</p><p></p><p>Finally, to clarify\xa0an important point for written 2: An assertion is <em>supported</em>\xa0if\xa0we can prove it's always true using only logical reasoning.</p>",written2|written3|lectures

Part c of the last question. Filling the blanks,"<p>Hello!<br /><br />I was checking the last question of the written homework and I am not completely sure how to proceed. You explain the two possible termination arguments possibilities, and there are some additional blanks which are not filled. I assume that it is because it refers to a generic quantity of variable.<br /><br />Then, below, there is the argument whose blanks we need to fill. If I understand it correctly, from the give function in the hw\xa0(compute_square), we need to pick up which one of the two arguments forms (with larger/bigger or smaller) is the appropriate for this case? As well, the not filled blanks in this answer should be empty too?<br /><br />Thanks, best,<br />Javier</p>",written1

Laptop setup office hours,"<p>If you need help setting up your laptop to work on assignments, we will have a laptop setup session on <strong>Wednesday from 4:30 to 6:30 in GHC 8102</strong>.\xa0 This is will allow you to work remotely (either by installing C0 on your laptop or by setting up ssh to login to a Unix machine).</p><p></p><p>Note that you can go at any time between 4:30 and 6:30 (so don't all come at 4:30).</p><p></p><p>You can also set up your laptop yourself by following the instructions at <a href=""http://c0.typesafety.net/tutorial/C0-at-CMU.html"">http://c0.typesafety.net/tutorial/C0-at-CMU.html</a> .\xa0 See also Piazza postings @8, @9 and @10.</p><p></p><p>A third way is to go to one of the alternate setup labs (see @18) and ask a TA to help once you've done the lab.</p><p></p><p><strong>TO CLARIFY --\xa0</strong>There are two things you need to do this week:</p><p>1) Complete Lab 1 (the ""setup lab"").

Alternate setup lab,"<p>The first lab of the semester (the ""setup lab"") is where you get to practice using Unix, editing and running C0 files, and submitting to Gradescope/Autolab.\xa0 The writeup and handout are on Autolab, and also here for your convenience:</p><ul><li><a href=""http://cs.cmu.edu/~15122/misc/lab01-writeup.pdf"">http://cs.cmu.edu/~15122/misc/lab01-writeup.pdf</a></li><li><a href=""http://cs.cmu.edu/~15122/misc/lab01-handout.tgz"">http://cs.cmu.edu/~15122/misc/lab01-handout.tgz</a></li></ul><p></p><p>This lab is exceptionally taking place on <strong>Friday this week in the CS clusters (GHC 5207, 5208, 5210)</strong>.\xa0 Many of you will want to get that practice sooner than that so that you can feel more confident working on the first written homework.\xa0 Therefore, we are scheduling additional setup labs <strong>Wednesday and Thursday from 6:30 to 8:30 in the CS clusters</strong>.\xa0 If you want to take advantage of them, just show up, notify a TA and go to a free computer (you may need to wait since there is a limited number of computers).\xa0 Once you're done, you can also step aside and work on setting up your laptop (see also next post).</p><p></p><p>Note that you can go at any time between 6:30 and 8:30 (so don't all come at the same time).</p><p></p><p>If you decide to go to one of these additional sessions, you don't need to go to the regular lab on Friday.</p><p></p><p>The setup lab is not graded (you don't earn points for it).\xa0 Other labs are however -- see how it works on the web site.</p><p></p><p><strong>TO CLARIFY --\xa0</strong>There are two things you need to do this week:</p><p>1) Complete Lab 1 (the ""setup lab"").
