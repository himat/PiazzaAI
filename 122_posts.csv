Carnival homework schedule,"As you are probably aware of, Carnival starts on Thursday April 20th.  But Thursdays are when programming assignments are typically due.  In the past, when we kept it that way, we had a lot of unhappy people working on their code while everybody else was having a good time.  To avoid this, in recent years we have been shifting the schedule a bit.  Namely, for about 2 weeks starting right after midterm 2, written and programming assignments will be swapped (written hw due on Thursdays and programming hw on Mondays).  Specifically (major changes are in <strong>bold</strong>): written 10 is due on Monday April 3 (normal schedule)<em><strong>nothing</strong> is due on <strong>Thursday April 6</strong></em> (the day of midterm 2)<strong>prog 9</strong> is due on <strong>Monday April 10</strong><strong>written 11</strong> is due on <strong>Thursday April 13</strong><strong>prog 10</strong> is due on <strong>Monday April 17</strong>written 12 is due on Monday April 24 (back to normal schedule)prog 11(a) is due on Thursday April 27 (back to normal schedule) After that, the schedule is normal again.

And once we see a lights out board, we return the steps that lead to turning all the lights out (i.e. the 'solution'). I'm just confused how we can still do that without being to explicitly accessing the steps, which I thought can be an extra field in struct board_data.

Index range = [0,height*width)  Board 4x3 -1              ##00       0### 000# Solution: 4,5,9,11  Board 3x3 ### 0#0 #0# Solution: 0,1,2,3,5  Board 3x3 #00 000 000 Solution: 0,2,5,6,7  Board 3x3-1 0## 0#0 0#0 Solution: 4,5,6,7  Board 4x3 #0## #0## 0#00 Solution: 2,4,5,8,10,11  ",public,lightsout

Task 5,"In hdict.h, the function hdict_insert will return a hdict_value if the key inserted already existed in the hash table, it will return the old hdict_value. So in our board-ht.c, what should we do with this return hdict_value? Should we free it?",public,lightsout
using hdict_t,I don't get how we can use the hdict_t interface since it's a generic interface that'll requires us to cast from void pointers to other stuff? ,public,lightsout
Correct way to xmalloc,bitvector *key = xmalloc(sizeof(bitvector));  Would this create a pointer to memory that is the size of bitvector?  Because I keep getting an invalid write on this line and I don't know why.  Sterling,private,lightsout
Somehow writing to free'd memory despite me never freeing any memory.,"In my function,  when I insert my board into the hashtable for the first time, somehow I'm writing to already free'd memory despite the fact that up to that point in my program, I don't free any memory! How is this possible?  Sterling",public,lightsout
solvable and unsolvable boards,"In task 6 , how do we determine if a board is solvable?",public,lightsout
char* vs string,can we use char * and string interchangeably in C? ,public,other

file_read,"I think we're supposed to somehow use file_read in our main functions for Task 6. However, I'm confused as to how we obtain all the fields that file_read needs as arguments like width_out and height_out. I know it says that it writes the vector of bits into 'vec_out' and writes the width into 'width_out' if reading the lightboard from the file path is a ""success"", but I don't get how this is useful for when we need to use it in the main function to obtain the board.

Hash arrays of bool values?,"I have tried to cast bitvector into size_t and use that as the hash value, but this will not work if bit vector is represented as an array of bool values (I believe that's the reason the below autolab test failed). Using bitvector_get does not always work since i can be some other type than uint8_t. Is it possible to hash use random int or memory address of pointer key? But then the same bitvector stored at different memory addresses will have different hash values. Is there a way to hash both arrays of bool values and ints? <pre>Test board-ht-array-grade add_many, expect successful execution  *** TEST FAILED! Expected successful execution. *** Actual outcome: The program, when run, produced the wrong answer *** Hint: Runs earlier tests on a representation of bitvectors as arrays of boolean values *** Likely to fail if you use == instead of bitvector_equal() to check for equality anywhere, *** or otherwise violate the interface.</pre>",public,lightsout

bitvector_new() confusion about numbers,"In the write-up it says  A single 32-bit integer could, by the same principle, store up to 32 true/false values. That is what the bit vector implementation that you will be implementing does. Bit vectors are an abstraction that assists us in eciently manipulating small sequences of bits. We'll use these sequences of true/false bits to store the on/o squares in a Lights Out board. The function bitvector_new() gives us a fresh bit vector containing only false bits.  So in my bitvector_new() I understand that I should return a 32 bit integer with all zeros. but which representation should this be in? I am wondering if I am overthinking it because if it is like bloom filters just 0 will be a 32 bit integer all in zeros right?

Questions,"Hi   I have some questions.  1. Where should I put my typedef. In this problem, we have 2 typedef. One is about queue_t, which is also in queue.h, so we do not need to care about it since we just include queue.h file. Second is the list type. I do not know where I should put it. I tried putting it in queue.c but then in the test file it shows that ""unknown type name  list "" and "" list  undeclared"". Since we could not include .c file, how could I let the test file know what list type is?  2. The second problem is about the queue-use.c1. I read posts about it but I am still confused. We do not have to convert it to c but what if we need it in our test file? If I tried to call these functions in my test file, where should I put these functions? in the test file itself?  3. The third question is about the xmalloc and xcalloc. Should it return void* or the pointer to the argument type? Like,  int *x = xmalloc(sizeof(int)), the right hand side return an int* or a void*?    4. In the free function. So we should check whether the function pointer is NULL. If it is NULL, what do you mean by freeing its internal data structures? I am confused with what the internal structure mean? Should I free the queue itself if the function pointer is NULL? If the function pointer is not NULL, then should we free all the data in all the nodes and then free the queue itself? Could you please explain these two cases detailedly?    Thank you!

Written 10 Question 3.1 (a),"While grading question 3.1 (a) on the most recent written homework, we came across a lot of common missteps that should be acknowledged/corrected:  If you're still confused about these or any other concepts, there are office hours in GHC 4307 until 10 pm tonight (Tues) as well as the same location from 8 - 10 pm Wednesday. (6-8pm O.H. are replaced by the review session, in Rashid Auditorium)  <strong>Casting a struct pointer before accessing a field</strong> The arrow operator (->), which accesses the field of a struct pointer, has a higher precedence than casting. This means that the expression (report*)x->current_price first tries to get the current_price field of x, then casts the result to a report*. This wouldn't compile, as you can't dereference a void* in c0. To fix this issue, you need parentheses around the cast: <pre>((report*)x)->current_price</pre> <em>Note</em>: if you're not sure of the order of operations, it's better to be explicit and insert extra parentheses than to guess and get it wrong. In the future, your code may be read by a programmer (maybe even your future self) who isn't certain of the precedence of the operators, so resolving ambiguity is important.  Another common misstep was to add an extra dereference, for example (*(report*)x)->current_price. Remember that foo->bar is equivalent to (*foo).bar, so you don't need a star in addition to the arrow, unless you are dereferencing a pointer stored in the struct field.  <strong>Minheap vs. Maxheap</strong> In this question, although we wanted to keep the n largest price increases, you needed a priority function that prioritized smaller price increases. In the first while loop, we want to remove the report from the priority queue that has the smallest price increase. pq_rem removes the <em>highest priority element first</em>, so your priority function needed to assign highest priority to the smallest price increase. <em>Note</em>: Remember that 'higher priority' doesn't imply 'higher value' - priority is an abstract notion that you (the client) define by implementing the priority function which you pass by pointer to pq_new.  <strong>Why does the priority queue's capacity need to be n + 1?</strong> This was particularly tricky. The reason for this was **<em>NOT** because of the unused zeroth index in our heap implementation</em>, but because of a particular edge case in the given algorithm. Since the algorithm specifies that you immediately remove a report whenever the priority queue is full, at the end of the loop you end up with at most (capacity - 1) elements in the priority queue. In order to keep the n largest elements, you needed to have room to store n + 1 elements. You could think of the loop body as doing the following: <ol>add one element to the priority queueif there are n + 1 elements, drop the smallest so only the n largest remain.</ol>",public,written10

It's really short, I promise. It'll be due tomorrow night [April 1st ;) ;) ;)] at 9pm. It's short!!!! Do it quick, and you'll be okay.   Due to the abrupt nature of this assignment, no help will be given by TAs at office hours. Don't worry - the TAs playtested the assignment and no TA took more than 15 minutes in total.  Also, Autolab ran out of memory, so I'm going to post it here. The handout says how to submit, so everything should be pretty straightforward. No need to ask questions. It's 3 short and easy questions, inflated to be out of 2147483647 points as a boost for your grade.

"lecture 17, complexity of PQs as arrays","I wanted to check my understanding about this line on page 5, section 4 of lecture 17: ""Typically, when using a priority queue, we expect the number of inserts and deletes to roughly balance.Then neither the unordered nor the ordered array provide a good data structure since a sequence of $$n$$ inserts and deletes will have worst-case complexity O($$n^2$$ )."" Does this mean: In an unordered array, if you want to delete $$n$$ elements that you just inserted, for each $$n$$ (which took O(1) time to insert), it takes O($$n$$) deletions so that's O($$n^2$$). But in a sorted array, it takes O($$n$$) time to insert $$n$$ elements, so while removing them takes O(1) time, the whole process already took O($$n^2$$) time. ?",public,lectures

We are not allowed to make the NULL rope a leaf with the empty string because of the definition of leaf from the writeup (must have string length>0), and we cannot share characters from the other leaf because it only has string_length of 1.

How to Draw Trees/Graphs Online Easily,"Some Written HWs might ask you to draw graphs after some operations are performed on them. There's an online site that allows you to do this less painfully than drawing or using MS Paint.

FOR MAC USERS: You can delete a node by pressing fn + delete. 3) When you're done making your graph, hit the ""Export as PNG"" button below the white screen, then click ""Save image as."" Give it a name and destination folder. If you're using LaTeX you have that option as well. 4) After you downloaded it, insert it into whatever PDF editor you're using. <a href=""http://www.pdfescape.com/"">http://www.pdfescape.com/</a> makes this very simple - you can click the ""Insert Image"" button and then click and drag on your screen to establish the size of the image.

Blotched AVL rotation example in class,"Earlier in class, the example I had in my notes of where a single rotation is not sufficient to restore the height invariant in an AVL tree after an insert, did not work out.  Here's an actual example.  Consider the AVL tree <pre>            40         /       \\     20            60   /    \\ 10      30</pre> and let's insert 35: <pre>T':       => 40         /       \\     20            60   /    \\ 10      30           \\            35</pre> Ok.  We have a height invariant violation (indicated with ""=>"" and ""<="").  What happens if we rotate the tree right at 40? <pre>           20 <=         /       \\     10            40                 /    \\               30      60                 \\                  35</pre> This doesn't work!  We still have a violation, and doing a left rotation on 20 will get us back to the previous tree.  We need to carry out a <em>double-rotation</em>, which amounts to first doing a left rotation at 20 (in the original tree, T') and then a right rotation at 40.  Let's do it in steps: Rotate left at 20 (note that this is a node <em>below</em> the first violation) <pre>            => 40            /       \\         30           60       /   \\     20     35   / 10</pre> Rotate right at 40  <pre>          30       /        \\     20          40   /           /    \\ 10          35      60</pre> Now we are back to a tree that respects the height invariant, a valid AVL tree.  When to use each rotation? <strong>Single rotation: </strong>when the imbalance occurs in an outer subtree, i.e.,   and the symmetric case.  You can see how it all works out with generic tree on the slides posted on the course web site (<a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/misc/avl.pdf"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/misc/avl.pdf</a>) and (done in slightly different way) on the lecture notes for the AVL lecture.  If you want to see how insertion works on concrete AVL trees, there are a number of animations on the web, for example <a href=""http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html"">http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html</a> .

As a result, some people got 0.5 point deducted for not removing all elements with that key in the chain (first argument of remove_from_chain).  We fixed this by: Changing the weight of the rubric item ""<em>Removes current element iff key is k</em>"" from 0.5 points to 1 pointRemoving the incorrect rubric item ""<em>Removes all elements with key k</em>""  Consequently, the people above are now getting an additional 0.5pt.

Mid-semester grades,"The mid-semester grades have been posted on S3 and will become visible on Monday (March 13th) at 4pm -- S3 makes it rather cumbersome to release grades ahead of their set schedule for a large class.  The grades were based on written hw 1 to 7, programming hw 1 to 6 (style points for EXP included), on midterm 1, and on the participation points (labs and quizzes up to now).  That amounted to 39.95% of the grades that are available in the course (all future hw and exams account for the rest).  The letter grades were computed in a most naive way based on the grade-threshold table below (<em>g</em> >=92% is A, 92% < <em>g</em> <= 90% is A-, etc), where <em>g</em> is your cumulative grade on the items above scaled to 100%. This number <em>g</em> is also very close to the value the rightmost point of the thick red line in the grade forecaster.  As you look at your mid-semester grade, there are a couple of <span style=""text-decoration:underline"">important things</span> to keep in mind: <strong>60.05% of the points for the course are still for grabs</strong>.  This means that if you did not do as well as you hoped for, there is plenty of opportunity for corrections.<strong>The mid-semester grade is <span style=""text-decoration:underline"">rather optimistic</span></strong>. It does not account for the fact that, in general, students do much better in homework than in exams (and we had many more hw points than exam points so far).  <span style=""text-decoration:underline"">To get a more accurate sense of how you are doing</span>, use the ""what-if"" section of the grade forecaster and plug your grade for midterm 1 (in percentages) in for midterm 2 and for the final. The updated red line will tell you where you are really headed.  So, some will want to make corrections even if the posted mid-semester grade is their ultimate goal.<strong>The table below is <span style=""text-decoration:underline"">NOT</span> the way we will compute the course grades</strong>.  This will be based on some kind of thresholds (still TBD) between letter grades and on your individual performance on the various parts of the course.  Unlike the mid-semester grades, it won't be based on a rigid formula -- see course web site for further details.  Also, just to dispel any lingering myth, this course is not curved (see note below for what ""curving"" implies and why you really don't want that.

How is 15-122 going?  Now with responses and comments,"We have put together a brief survey to get a better sense of how things are going from your perspective. This will help us correct any issues for the rest of the term and improve future editions. The survey is anonymous, so please feel free to speak your mind. You can find it at: <a href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LLPLNNN"" target=""_blank"">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LLPLNNN</a> The survey will close on next Sunday night (March 19).  <em>[Disclaimer: there are a few things we won't be able to change, namely the topics 15-122 covers, and the expectations in terms of homework/exams -- those were set by the people who designed the course]</em>   <span style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong>Survey outcomes:</strong></span> First, thank to all of those who took the time to fill the survey!  This input is really valuable for making 15-122 better.  In fact, without feedback from you, we would not be able to know of certain things that need to get fixed.  Below is a summary of responses, with some comments (in <em>italics</em>).  <em><strong>What worked well?</strong></em> (In no particular order) programming hw, lectures, labs, office hours, recitations, Piazza, bonus, TAs, Gradescope, instructors, written hw. <em>Given that this is pretty much all we do, it looks like everybody found something good in the course (although not everybody the same thing).</em>  <em><strong>What should be done better?</strong></em> Pretty much the same things that other said worked well, minus Piazza and Gradescope. <em>This means everybody found something that can be improved.</em>Participation points (more quizzes, lab points, points for recitation, ...) <em>You shouldn't worry too much: (a) historically the vast majority of the class got the full 5% by the end of the semester, (b) there will be plenty more opportunities to earn participation points, (c) it's a tiny fraction of the total score for the course.</em>Go over quizzes in class. <em>Sure, why not?</em>Assess how many students earn the ""3rd lab point"" and call it a ""bonus point"". <em>How many students got 3 points in lab varied a lot throughout the semester, from a low of 8% to a high of 72% with an average of 40%.  While this is fairly normal, we monitor the trends and make adjustments to labs to keep it more predictable.</em> <em>If that helps, you are free to view it as a bonus point.</em>Written and programming hw are hard compared to what is covered in class. <em>Of course!  The lectures are meant to introduce building blocks and basic concepts, and do so in the limited time we have available.  Assignments are meant to explore them further by combining them in sophisticated ways.</em>Lectures and lecture notes are not an exact match. <em>The two are very close but indeed there are some differences.  One the one hand, we do want to expose you to different ways to approach the same concept, simply because different approaches resonate differently with different students -- use the one that best helps you learn.  On the other hand, lectures are where we experiment with new ways to present some concepts, and if they work we later incorporate them into the lecture notes.</em>Make 15-122 more like 15-112. <em>Sorry, you graduated from that one already.</em>Don't force us to go to specific lectures, we are college students! <em>Blame (or thank) the fire marshal, not us!  By law, we are not allowed to fit more people than the official capacity of a room. Regulating attendance is one way to make sure 400 people don't show up to the lecture/labs/recitations that are late in the day.</em>Written/programming assignments are unclear. <em>While this is not intentional, you will see that as you progress through your studies assignments will have less and less precise instructions.  One reason is that as things get more complex, it is harder to spell everything out.  A second reason is that the parts that are not fully spelled out can generally be inferred from the context or from what you have done so far.  The most important reason, though, is that very little is fully spelled out in real life, and that's what we are preparing you for, in part.</em>Keep the best Autolab submission rather than the last one. <em>No objection to that, but Autolab does not support it and doing so manually would require many more resources than we have available.</em>  <em><strong>How is the pace of the course?</strong></em> Too fast: 17%A bit fast: 41%Just right: 31%A bit slow: 10%Too slow: 0%  <em><strong>Any additional comments?</strong></em> Various expressions of love or dislike for this and that.More practice problems. <em>There are a few at the end of the notes for each lectures and we will adding more.  We can also give some at the end of class.</em>More bonus problems. <em>We are trying to find the right balance.  Weaker students tend to find lots of bonus problems demoralizing, while stronger students love them.</em>   <strong>Some general comments:</strong> There are a few things mentioned above that we cannot change as individual instructors.  These include the topics covered by the course and the performance expectations to pass the class.  This impacts the kind and difficulty of the assignments and the pace of the course.  Said this, the overall group of 15-122 instructors (not just the ones you see) review the course periodically and we are taking into account your feedback.  There are also some things we will not change because, based on past experience, they lead to reduced learning and lower performance overall.  These include a few things that some of you find unpalatable, like the very notion of a participation grade (even if ours is a small one), having written and programming assignment as separate hw, and the collaboration policy.  Finally, there are the logistical challenges of managing one of the largest course on campus (15-122 was the largest class on campus last Fall; I haven't heard about this Spring yet).  Many of our policies and procedures are dictated by this: heavy use of automation, strict rules, rare exceptions, etc.  We don't have the luxury of being as accommodating as some of the other classes you have taken or are taking simply because we don't have the resources to do so (or we would have to significantly lower what you are getting out of this class, which we can't do).

I also used tbuf_row in the other editor functions and they could work in tbuf well, why does only this is_editor one get wrong?   Also, when I test tbuf_row and col function, I think I did get the correct answer but in autolab, it just told me I got it wrong. I played with my editor and tbuf but all of them work well. I tried lots of input and I think all of them have good position value and good operation. Could you give me some hints about it?  The last one is that, in the write up, it says that the editor function should not change buffer even if the current operation is not valid, for example, even the cursor is at the leftmost position, if we call editor backward, it should not raise errors. So I used if condition instead of contract to rule the invalid cases out. So if there is a bad position, my function will do nothing. But in the test case in autolab, it requires me to fail a contract under bad location. It seems that it is self-conflicting. So the editor just want us to call tbuf function, also we need to update the row and col values of the E and in this process, we should not use the tbuf_row function but could use tbuf_col function,  right?   I spent almost 20 hours on this homework but still could not figure out what is wrong. : ( Also, do you have office hour today so that I could ask some questions?

Say in our library interface we have a helper function to get a hash value for an elem we want to add into the hash table, then we're limiting a client who uses our library interface to this one hash function.

tokens example from recitation,"I'm still a little unclear about how the tokens model works for the example we did in recitation today where we incremented the limit by 1.5 instead of 2. So say we had an array that was:  |1|2|_|_|  Then we add in a 3 and 4, and our amortized cost is 4 tokens for each to do so.        ... ... |1|2|3|4|  Now, we resize and we spend a token to copy each element over:  .  .  . . |1|2|3|4|_|_|  Now we have 2 tokens saved up. Now say we want to add in some new elements 5 and 6 - so now we have spent those 2 tokens and then we spend 4 more.   .  .  . .  ... ...  |1|2|3|4| 5| 6|   Now when we copy into a new array, we get:   .  .  .  . .  .  |1|2|3|4|5|6|_|_|_|  but now we have 4 tokens left over. We can then spend those four tokens for writing each new one, and we have one more saved. So instead of paying 3*3 = 9 tokens, we can now spend only 9-4 = 5 tokens across the whole. So now we have spent 5 tokens. I thought that the whole point was that we were supposed to spend an amortized cost of 4 tokens each time? ",private,lectures

And else (x != int_max()) then according to the order of computation won't (x/2 - min/2) / (max/2 - min/2) be 0, and so guess always = lo? 2. Q3 In the question body it says A[i] <= T[right - 1, n). Why is it right - 1 while both in L20 and implementation of L29 we're only ensuring A[i] <= T[right, n)?",public,midterm1

Testing for robust test cases instead of functions,"Hi,  I would wish to clarify: Are we getting points for writing robust test cases? Because even if I keep my functions and contracts unchanged, how am I able to increase my points on autolab by writing test cases that obviously pass when the function is correct.  I have faced the same problem in previous homeworks as well. After getting a lower score first I spent a lot of time writing additional contracts and changing my function where as when I added 1 test case to take a zero length array for vocab I immediately got a 7.8 from a 4. Does this mean that in order to get a full score, I need to exploit all distinct test cases even though I am certain my functions and contracts are sufficient and correct.  I would be glad if you could clarify this.  Thank You. ",private,doslingos

Written 4 Problem 3 (c) Rubric/Common Mistakes,"<em><strong>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE SUBMITTING A REGRADE REQUEST FOR PROBLEM 3 (C)</strong></em>  While grading Problem 3 (c), we realized that the rubric items on gradescope did not fully cover all of the possible combinations of code that could arise in responses, so we were forced to make certain (somewhat hidden) changes to how we were grading Problem 3 (c) based on the loop invariants. Therefore, we decided to post a general outline of how we graded this problem. Point 2 on the gradescope rubric is received either if Point 1 was received AND the postcondition given was safe or if Point 1 was not received AND there was an explicit check of safety of array accesses in the postcondition. Note that this means that if no array access was made in the postcondition and you did not receive point 1 it is impossible to receive points for point 2.Point 7 on the gradescope rubric is received either if Point 6 was received AND the postcondition given was safe or if Point 6 was not received AND there was an explicit check of safety of array accesses in the postcondition. Note that this means that if no array access was made in the postcondition and you did not receive point 6 it is impossible to receive points for point 7.The correct loop invariants were anything equivalent to ge_seg(x, A, 0, lo) and lt_seg(x, A, hi, n). If you had something different, this changed how exactly we graded the rest of the problem. Specifically If the loop invariants were too weak (for instance, using ge_seg(x, A, 0, lo) and le_seg(x, A, hi, n), there was a 0.25 point deduction applied to the problem, and no credit could be given for Point 6 on the Gradescope rubric. If the loop invariants were unsafe, syntactically incorrect, self-contradictory or impossible to satisfy, no credit was given for points 3-6 <em>regardless of if they matched the rubric</em>.If the loop invariants were something else, they were handled on a case by case basis. In general though, we graded points 4-7 in context of the loop invariants. It was possible for points 4/6 to be exactly what was written on the rubric, but not to receive points due to them not making sense in context of the loop invariants   <strong>Some Mistakes to avoid (Some were common)</strong> Some people used \\length(A) instead of n in the postcondition. Be careful doing this, as in many cases this could result in an incorrect postcondition. For instance, consider the below array, where x = 15122 and n = 3. If our postcondition was ... && (\\result == \\length(A)-1 || A[\\result + 1] > x. In that case, a result of 2 is the correct answer, but would violate the ensures statement! (A[result + 1] < x) <table width=""717"" height=""36"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""6px"" border=""1""><tbody><tr><td>10000</td><td>10100</td><td>15122</td><td>10100</td><td>10000</td></tr></tbody></table>  A lot of people missed Point 5 because of an incorrect negation. Be careful - !(A && B) $$\ eq$$ !A. Instead, !(A && B) = !A || !B.If your code barely fits (or doesn't fit) in the space provided, it likely is overly complicated. Make your TAs happy, and increase your chances at getting a point, by simplifying your code! This goes for your proofs as well Test your code! A lot of people could have avoided missed points if they just tried it out to see if it worked  <strong>Note:</strong> This will likely be the only time we will post the full rubric/common mistakes for any homework ",public,written4

If I put the conditional on line 23 as A[mid] <= x and the assert statement on line 25 as A[mid] > x, on the first iteration, mid would be 4. A[4] = 4, which is <= x. So lo = mid + 1 = 5. But that would mean that the loop would continue to search from indices 5 to hi, which disregards the fact that A[mid] = x.  If I instead switch where the equals goes to. So the conditional on line 23 would instead be A[mid] < x and the assert statement on line 25 would be A[mid] >= x. For array A = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4] where x = 4 and n = 8, on the first iteration of the loop, mid would be 4. A[4] = 4, which is not < x so the loop would go to the else statement (the assert statement verifies that A[4] >= x). So, hi = mid = 4. But that would mean that the loop would continue to search from indices 0 to 4, which wouldn't find the last occurrence which is in the part of the array from indices 4 to 7.

"Written 1d, can we manipulate n?","For problem 1d in Written Homework 4, the base case scenario would occur if n = 0, meaning that nothing would need to be checked, leading to a complexity of O(1). However, the question asks us to state the answer as a function of n. So then, it would be O(n). My question is, can we consider n to be 0 as best case, or do we have to create a best-case scenario for any n?",private,written4

accounting for constants when finding closed form expression,"Hi, how do we account for constants when finding closed form expressions? For example if I have: for ( loop runs n times ) {     int j = 0     if (j > 1):         do something } Would this be T(3n) because it executes 3 lines of code n times?  Or for example: for ( loop runs n times) {     do something     for (loop runs n^2 + 2n times) {        do something     } } Would this be T(n^3 + 2n + n) because the loop does n^2 + 2n + 1 commands n times?

Questions about Written 4,"1. For proving Big-O in Question 1-C), I was trying to follow the definition of Big-O that we went over in class and in recitation. However, I remember that we did not define c and n0 from the beginning and the definition also says that there exist ""some c and n0"". On the other hand, I also took this course last semester and I remembering talking with the TA over my regrade issues because I got points off for not setting the c and n0 values initially but rather meddling with the two functions first to calculate an appropriate value for the two variables. But this was the method we did in recitation -- so I'm very confused what to follow right now. What exactly should the order for proving Big-O be?  2. For Question 2-B), instruction tells me to prove that when the code returns on line 18, the postconditions on line 4-7 always evaluates to true. However, from my knowledge, line for would return False and the rest True. Thus F||T&&T&&T would evaluate to true. Am I getting on the wrong track? If I am right should I also be proving that the postcondition on line 4 will return False?  Thanks!",private,written4

Stable sorting,"In lecture, we classified sorting algorithms based on whether they were <strong>fast or slow</strong> and based on whether they were processing the array <strong>in-place</strong> (i.e., they did not need to allocate a new array) or not.  Another useful property is whether they are <strong>stable</strong>.  Stability makes sense when you are sorting not just a number but a record (e.g., your iTunes collection or student grades).  Let's take that as an example: say I have a spreadsheet with your andrew IDs and your homework grades.  Most of the time it is sorted by andrew ID (that makes entering grades faster), but after each hw is graded it is useful to sort it by grade so to see who did well and who needs help.  When I do that, what happens to the andrew IDs? <ol>They can remain in the same order for each grade (e.g., the andrew IDs of everybody who got 10 are still in order).They end up in shuffled, thereby losing the order.</ol> A sorting algorithm that guarantees (1) is stable: entries with the same sorting value remain sorted.  How do the sorting algorithms we examined fare?  Here's a summary:  <table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""6px"" border=""1""><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Fast?</strong></td><td><strong>In-place?</strong></td><td><strong>Stable?</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Selection sort</strong></td><td style=""text-align:center"">NO!</td><td style=""text-align:center"">Yes</td><td style=""text-align:center""> Yes </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Insertion Sort</strong></td><td style=""text-align:center"">NO!</td><td style=""text-align:center"">Yes</td><td style=""text-align:center""> Yes </td></tr><tr><td> <strong>Merge sort</strong> </td><td style=""text-align:center"">Yes</td><td style=""text-align:center"">NO!</td><td style=""text-align:center"">Yes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Quick sort</strong></td><td style=""text-align:center""><em>Mostly</em></td><td style=""text-align:center"">Yes</td><td style=""text-align:center"">NO!</td></tr></tbody></table>  Challenge questions: What does find_min need to guarantee for selection sort to be stable?What needs to be guaranteed for merge sort to be stable?Why is quick sort not stable",public,lectures

images: is_valid_imagesize,"Hi,   I'm working on writing the preconditions described in the imageutil.c0 file, copied here: <pre>// Checks whether width and height are valid dimensions. To be valid // dimensions, width and height must be strictly positive, and // multiplying width*height must not cause overflow.</pre> According to the C0 tutorial page on Ints, there are only two cases for overflow - dividing or modding the minimal integer by -1. (Although, wouldn't multiplying int_min by -1 also cause overflow?)  If my first precondition makes sure that width > 0 and height > 0, then wouldn't width*height never cause overflow, because they would never be int_min or -1? So the only precondition needed is width > 0 and height > 0, and the overflow one described is redundant?  EDIT: I realized the function is already written, so no preconditions necessary. So I guess my edited question is about the line here: <pre>width <= int_max() / height</pre> Why is width*height <= int_max() required? (Since C0 tutorial says multiplication will never overflow?) And is there a reason that int_max() / height is on the right instead of writing ""width*height <= int_max()"", or is that stylistic?",private,images

Loop invariant preservation,"I am wondering whether exiting a loop because of return statements would violate the preservation of loop invariant. By definition, a loop invariant is supposed to hold before and after the loop iteration and I think it is inappropriate for a loop to have return statements inside because that could lead to safety issues since the loop does not exit appropriately. (Does not exit because the loop guards evaluate to false). Therefore, we cannot guarantee anything about the postcondition anymore. (NOT loop guard AND loop invariants).

Three questions,"1. When we are reasoning over the postconditions, loop invariants and loop guards are all the information that we can rely on, right?

(BTW, A[i] > x written inside the loop). If loop guards and loop invariants are all the information that we can rely on, does it mean that we can deduce the loop invariants based on the postconditions?  2. The concept of operational reasoning is frequently mentioned in this course but I still cannot tell a clear difference between it and ""logical reasoning"". What is the difference between them? Is there any perfect example to illustrate the difference?  3.""Ensures"" require the variable to be unchanged by the function. Does ""requires"" also have the same requirement? ",private,other

Confused about pixel writeup,"I made this private because I know there's been quite a few questions on this, but I'm still confused how to get started. I have a few questions that I don't think have been answered (if they have, I must have missed the post and I apologize):  1. What's the difference between the concrete and abstract type? I get that one's for the client to use, but fundamentally what's the difference? It seems like the abstract type is defined using the concrete type, so from what I understand that means a pixel is an int, and a pixel_t is a pixel which is an int. Is that correct? 2. Does that mean in the functions with pixel p argument that it's just requiring a 32-bit integer? How is that different from just requiring an int? 3. I'm assuming we put together a pixel based on the four helper functions, does that mean to piece together the integer using the four helpers? 4. How does an ""interface"" fit into all of this? I read section 3 but I don't think I totally got it.  Sorry for asking for so much clarification but I could use the help. Thanks!",public,pixels

Tips on Reasoning about Code,"A common question among students each semester is ""Can I use -------- to justify this statement? What kind of statements am I allowed to make?"" This post is an attempt to clarify how we reason about code and structure our proofs in 15-122.  There are two kinds of reasoning that we use in 15-122: logical reasoning and operational reasoning.  <blockquote> <i>Logical reasoning</i> is using what we know to be <strong>true</strong> to prove certain properties about code. <em>Operational reasoning</em> is drawing conclusions about how things <strong>change</strong> when certain lines of code are run. </blockquote> Probably the best way to see the difference between these two types of reasoning is with examples. When we say things like this, we're using logical reasoning: ""we know x > 0 from the loop guard""""y is not modified in the loop""""on line 5, we know z % 4 == 0 because we must have entered an if (z % 4 == 0) {...} statement""  But when we say things like this, we're using operational reasoning: ""after an iteration of the loop, i' = i - 1""""x is strictly decreasing""""we know x < 0 because x > 0 by the loop guard and x = -x by line 5""  It's a common misconception that operational reasoning is always bad and should never be used. In fact, operational reasoning is often necessary to prove the correctness of functions. However, operational reasoning is more difficult and prone to error than logical reasoning, since you need to consider all of the possible effects any statement could have.  Because of this, we want to <strong>limit our use of operational reasoning to the smallest chunks of code possible</strong>. In particular, it's very difficult to reason about multiple iterations of a loop at once, so you should <strong>never</strong> make statements like ""the loop runs y times and x=0 initially, so x=y when the loop exits."" In 15-122, operational reasoning should only be used to prove preservation of loop invariants and loop termination.  Finally, to clarify an important point for written 2: An assertion is <em>supported</em> if we can prove it's always true using only logical reasoning.",public,written2|written3|lectures

Quiz 1,"Here are some statistics for <strong>Quiz 01</strong>, on a 0-5 scale: <pre>Max\t5 Min\t0 Avg\t3.4 Median\t3 StdDev\t1.1</pre> This is something you definitely need to pay attention to, not because quizzes are a lot of points, but because they are an indication of your understanding of what we are doing in class.  The 5 questions on this quiz were absolutely elementary: you all should be able to answer them correctly by simply sitting half awake in lecture.  This will be true of all future quizzes as well.  If your final grade in the course depended on answering 100 such questions (it is not -- don't panic), 5 incorrect answers would entail failing the class.  So, if you got anything short of a perfect score, you may want to reflect on the way you engage in the class -- improving on that will make everything else you  need to do for this course a lot easier.  The scores for quiz 1 will be uploaded to the grade forecaster next time a homework is graded, sometime this weekend.  Solutions will not be posted, but you can find them in the lecture notes and in your own notes from lecture.  This time around, <em>anonymous</em> did not get any points (you all put your IDs in), but <em>unreadable</em> got 5 points (a perfect score).",public,quizzes

puzzle function 3 @ensures clarification?,"Hi, I don't think I understand exactly how the same_start_end function is supposed to return only one substring.

I feel like there are a lot of potential answers for this function? Are all implementations valid?  For example, in this post (which is over 128 characters), every word between spaces seems like it's a valid substring, and also ""don't think I understand"" and the sections between the start/close parentheses and a number of other things.

Laptop setup office hours,"If you need help setting up your laptop to work on assignments, we will have a laptop setup session on <strong>Wednesday from 4:30 to 6:30 in GHC 8102</strong>.  This is will allow you to work remotely (either by installing C0 on your laptop or by setting up ssh to login to a Unix machine).  Note that you can go at any time between 4:30 and 6:30 (so don't all come at 4:30).  You can also set up your laptop yourself by following the instructions at <a href=""http://c0.typesafety.net/tutorial/C0-at-CMU.html"">http://c0.typesafety.net/tutorial/C0-at-CMU.html</a> .  See also Piazza postings @8, @9 and @10.  A third way is to go to one of the alternate setup labs (see @18) and ask a TA to help once you've done the lab.  <strong>TO CLARIFY -- </strong>There are two things you need to do this week: 1) Complete Lab 1 (the ""setup lab""). You must either go to one of the lab classrooms during your scheduled time on Friday, or go to one of the alternate lab sessions (see @18). 2) Set up your laptop to connect to the Andrew servers. This can be done on your own using the instructions on Piazza (@8, @9, @10), at the laptop setup office hours (above), or during your setup lab (see @18). ",public,logistics|labs
Alternate setup lab,"The first lab of the semester (the ""setup lab"") is where you get to practice using Unix, editing and running C0 files, and submitting to Gradescope/Autolab.  The writeup and handout are on Autolab, and also here for your convenience: <a href=""http://cs.cmu.edu/~15122/misc/lab01-writeup.pdf"">http://cs.cmu.edu/~15122/misc/lab01-writeup.pdf</a><a href=""http://cs.cmu.edu/~15122/misc/lab01-handout.tgz"">http://cs.cmu.edu/~15122/misc/lab01-handout.tgz</a>  This lab is exceptionally taking place on <strong>Friday this week in the CS clusters (GHC 5207, 5208, 5210)</strong>.  Many of you will want to get that practice sooner than that so that you can feel more confident working on the first written homework.  Therefore, we are scheduling additional setup labs <strong>Wednesday and Thursday from 6:30 to 8:30 in the CS clusters</strong>.  If you want to take advantage of them, just show up, notify a TA and go to a free computer (you may need to wait since there is a limited number of computers).  Once you're done, you can also step aside and work on setting up your laptop (see also next post).  Note that you can go at any time between 6:30 and 8:30 (so don't all come at the same time).  If you decide to go to one of these additional sessions, you don't need to go to the regular lab on Friday.  The setup lab is not graded (you don't earn points for it).  Other labs are however -- see how it works on the web site.  <strong>TO CLARIFY -- </strong>There are two things you need to do this week: 1) Complete Lab 1 (the ""setup lab"").

"Enrollment, homework, and more","If you are reading this, you have successfully enrolled in Piazza.  Congratulations!  As said in class, we use Autolab and Gradescope for homework distribution and submission: If you were on the roster of this class 10 minutes ago, you are now registered on Autolab (that's where the writeups for all assignments, labs and recitations will be posted and where you submit programming assignments).You need to self-register on Gradescope (that's where written hw gets submitted).  To do so, go to <a href=""https://gradescope.com"">https://gradescope.com</a> and sign up <strong>using YOUR ANDREW ADDRESS</strong> (no gmail or other email addresses) and entry code <strong>937B39</strong>.  (These instructions are also part of the setup lab.)  Written homework 1 is now posted -- you can get started.  It is due next Monday, at 9pm.  (In the future, we won't use Piazza to announce when new hw are posted: they come up automatically as per the table on the course web page -- <a href=""http://cs.cmu.edu/%7E15122"">http://cs.cmu.edu/~15122</a> .)  I forgot to mention in class why we have so many assignments (1 written and 1 programming each week most weeks -- sounds crazy!).  In the distant past, they used to be combined as one assignment due each week.  What happened was that some, well many, students spent most of their time on the programming part and did what they could on the written part in the 10 minutes before the deadline -- bad for learning and bad for grades.  That's why we decided to split them and have different deadlines.  We observe that the most successful students do them at the same time, going back and forth between written and programming -- and of course they start well ahead of the deadline.  Good luck in 15-122, and if you have questions, come talk to us!",public,logistics|other
