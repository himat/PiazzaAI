lightsout grades,prog lightsout is graded the grades are posted on the course web page click on the grades menu authenticate and you'll see your grades for this homework and a projection for future assessments this is a good way to get a sense of where you are headed in the course and take action if it does not match your expectations the participation entry accounts for all quizzes and labs up to today here are some statistics normalized as percentages max min t avg median stddev you can access test outcomes on autolab note some people got because they ran out of grace days in one case this was an autolab mistake if you believe autolab made a mistake in your case too email me we do occasionally make mistakes if you feel we incorrectly graded a question you have days from now to submit an appeal using the grade appeal procedure on the course web page we will not consider email or oral requests pin,public,lightsout

carnival homework schedule,as you are probably aware of carnival starts on thursday april th but thursdays are when programming assignments are typically due in the past when we kept it that way we had a lot of unhappy people working on their code while everybody else was having a good time to avoid this in recent years we have been shifting the schedule a bit namely for about weeks starting right after midterm written and programming assignments will be swapped written hw due on thursdays and programming hw on mondays specifically major changes are in bold written is due on monday april normal schedule nothing is due on thursday april the day of midterm prog is due on monday april written is due on thursday april prog is due on monday april written is due on monday april back to normal schedule prog a is due on thursday april back to normal schedule after that the schedule is normal again see the hw schedule on the course web page for details pin,public,logistics
how to do well on programming homeworks,as we move into the last part of the semester you'll notice that the programming homework assignments are getting longer more complex and more difficult instead of telling you exactly what to do and how to do it the programming assignment writeups will focus more on describing the fundamental concepts and expectations behind the assignment if you follow these steps you will probably learn more and do better on these assignments start early while in past weeks you might have been able to complete the programming assignments in a couple days you probably will not be able to do this going forward read the writeup carefully don't skip the sections at the beginning and jump to the task descriptions don't rely on folk wisdom from friends and classmates if you haven't read or don't understand every section of the writeup you will have trouble completing the assignment correctly if you have a question or are stuck on a task reread the relevant sections of the writeup first use the search field on piazza admittedly the search functionality on piazza isn't the best but you should be able to get good results by searching for a single keyword don't forget about the beginning of the course remember contracts loop invariants and correctness proofs while you might not be able to completely prove that your code is correct you should be able to reason through your logic and consider whether the code you've written makes logical sense hacking on the code until it works is rarely a good strategy for writing correct code pin,public,ropes lightsout c0vm queues

autolab arithmetic error,hi in this autolab error code test c vm tests task div bc expect c arith error tests failed hint problem with combination tests actual outcome an arithmetic error occurred doesn't it expect an arithmetic error it failed when the outcome was an arithmetic error am i giving the wrong type of error i got another one as well test c vmd tests task largediv bc expect c arith error tests failed hint problem with ildc arithmetic actual outcome an arithmetic error occurred my code passed all other tests though my error lines for idiv irem is if y c arith error error division by and my error lines for shifting is if y y c arith error error shifting i made this private because it contained code snippets thanks,private,c0vm
type of int for shifting protection,hi how do we find out the size of the integer being shifted in order to ensure shifting won't shift too far i e bit or bit integer or do we just assume any shifting under bits is safe,public,c0vm

int t or int t,for iadd should we be treating the numbers on the operand stack as int t or int t the writeup makes it sound like we should be treating them as int t but when i looked at the iadd bytecode the comments made it seem like we should be treating them as int t so that ff was not which one is it,private,c0vm
memory leakage,i am still working on my checkpoint and i am having memory leakage issues in the return i freed the s and v but should i be doing more where can i improve this memory leakages,private,c0vm
