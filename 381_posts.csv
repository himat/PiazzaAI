hmm questions,writing these out is quite tedious especially for a series of observations i understand it is important to do these calculations out to fully understand the algorithms however what is the purpose of making it so tedious with the amount of states and observations,public,hw4
hmm question,for part b i noticed that there is no observation does this mean that the hmm does not emit in its initial state,public,hw4
problem typo,note that in problem part b pillar should be vent,public,hw4
mean squared error,the mean squared error equation is given as frac y sum x t in y nn x t one thing i don't understand it seems like nn x and t are both vectors and so nn x t would be a vector when it says to square this vector presumably to produce a scalar is that shorthand for dot product with itself,public,hw4
bias,so regarding the bias a couple of questions should we include the bias as the last row of the weight matrix between the input and hidden layer or in some other way should the bias be included only for the layer from the input to the hidden layers or even for the layer from the hidden to output layer when we return w and w from the get weights function should we include the bias in any of these or only one or neither thanks for the help,public,hw4
matrix multiplication in the version of numpy installed on autolab,what is the equivalent to the normal numpy's np matmul in the version of numpy installed on autolab using np matmul results in this error attributeerror 'module' object has no attribute 'matmul',public,hw4
autolab test output increased,some of you have run into the issue in which you pass the first suite of tests but fail on the xor linear quadratic test cases as you may have noticed these latter test cases give you very little feedback this was intentional we don't want you to store all of the expected weight matrices and just feed them back to us however this makes it unduly difficult to debug so i've done two things i've broken up the test backward propagation test into more granular ones for each of these new backward propagation tests i've enabled output of the weight matrices so that you can see exactly what we are expecting for these test cases i hope this helps,public,hw4
testweightvalues,hello does test weight values on autolab test on initialization of weights or the weights after they have been run through a few iterations of the algorithm thanks,public,hw4
failing some autolab tests,what might be causing test quadratic linear xor to be failing on autolab i'm passing the first four tests autolab says weight matrices of submission and reference solutions did not match up so is there a way i can figure out how to fix this,private,hw4
the return value of forward propagate,in the forward propagate function's notation it says returns the activations on the output nodes but what does the activation in here exactly refer to is it just the sum of all the inputs from the hidden layer or is it the value after putting it through the sigmoid,public,hw4
initializing the weight for bias,when initializing an weight matrix do we initialize the section for the bias at the same time so in the past question rows vs columns it is said that so let me clarify this you should initialize your weight matrices to be consistent with the interface given in the comment of the get weights function specifically if matrix w goes between layers k and k which have n and m nodes in them respectively then you should store initialize your matrices in the following way np random rand n m that is the matrix should have n rows and m columns but this initialization does not seem to include the extra element which is for the bias,public,hw4
rows vs columns,i was storing my weights as matrices in a way that would allow me to do matrix multiplication using the convention of treating arrays as column vectors however i discovered that the get weights function wants the returned matrices to be formatted such that rows of the matrix correspond to the dimensions of the incoming activations and the columns correspond to the dimensions of the outgoing activations normally i would just transpose the weight matrices to return them in get weights but since we need to do the random initialization of weights in a very specific order i figured this also matters for order of initialization first of all am i correct in being thrown off by the way get weights wants us to return the matrices if we interpret i as the row and j as the column then the way the comment describes the output seems to indicate that we're supposed to return the matrices transposed from the way we would naturally want to store them secondly does this mean that we should also initialize the matrices in this counterintuitive transposed way i want to make sure to initialize my weights the exact way we're supposed to,public,hw4
target for hidden layer,how would you find the target values for the hidden layer would it just be a dot product of the errors of the output layer with the weights thanks,public,hw4

test quadratic test linear test xor,considering that passing the weight test forward propagation test and backward propagation test which i presume also includes training doesn't necessarily make these tests pass what are these tests on autolab testing is it just testing the actual test function thanks,public,hw4
neural net bias weight,hi all when you are adding the bias weight to your input vector make sure to add it at the end of the input vector as opposed to the beginning or anywhere else this is how the model solution does it and so this is what the autograder will expect the handout has been updated with some additional detail,public,hw4

nonsensical error message on a priori test,when i submit to autolab i'm passing all the estimate tests but the a priori tests fail with the following error valueerror array 'cov' must be at most two dimensional but cov ndim so i'm getting a on this because cov is two dimensional but it should be two dimensional this part of my code is relatively simple and i don't mess with the dimensions or shape of the things i pass into multivariate norm what are some reasons for why this error could be happening,public,hw3

gaussian dimensions,i'm not sure how the data is supposed to be interpreted in the gaussian question this is my understanding we should treat our images as vectors of length and use them as such in the calculation of the pdf this means that our mean is also a vector of length and our covariance is either a x matrix or a scalar in order for the multiplication to work i'm not sure which it should be is this right or am i completely misunderstanding,public,hw3

clarification on the gi's in problem,problem states that you can use the g i functions instead of the conditional probabilitie this is true if you use the formulation g i x p x omega i p omega i but not if you use the version with the logs why well these functions were originally introduced in the context of using bayes' rule for determining which state was most likely thus all we needed to preserve when moving from conditional probabilities to the g i 's was the relative ordering between the probability values however in the context of risk aversion we are multiplying these g i values by loss function values thus preserving the original conditional probabilities' relative multiplicative relationships is needed,public,hw3

homework release on autolab,homework is out on autolab if you have any trouble accessing it please let us know in the comments on this post this homework includes programming problems which as you may have learned be learning take a little while to debug sometimes so the course staff recommends you start early on this assignment that being said there are only questions total and the programming questions are simpler compared to previous programming problems keep in mind that the day after this homework is due is the midterm exam so the sooner you start and finish the more time you have to study update i have updated the readme with some clarification on the estimate parameters function for the gaussian classifier and i updated a test case in the handout code also i fixed a bug relating to the covariance matrices in the reference solution see the a priori test case for gauss was updated to be consistent with the other test cases types,public,hw3

fourier transform,i've read through the slides several times and looked in the textbook as well and i still don't understand what the fourier transform question is asking for as i understand it convolution is used to filter a signal though the diagrams on the slides don't make it clear exactly what this means and the fourier transform is used to approximate discrete functions like sign sin x using sin and cos however i don't understand what the impulse response of a system is this is mentioned nowhere in the slides or in the textbook help,public,hw2
means ends analysis psuedocode,if you are having trouble with implementing means ends analysis i have updated the psuedocode in the handout to be a little clearer about what to do if you fail to apply an operator edit also you should not just translate the pseudocode into python it is intentionally incomplete and meant to be a rough template that you need to fill gaps in examples of things that are left up to the programmer are visited state tracking and failure handling edit i updated the pseudocode again to include even more detail remember that the pseudocode is still incomplete there are yet details for you to discover and implement edit i've fixed a couple typos and added another line for clarity edit i've fixed a typo and gotten rid of an extraneous line,public,hw2

clarification on question dynamic programming,the instructions don't seem clear the instructions say this function should take the correct sentence and a list of possible corrections and return the cost of the best correction if the first line is already the correct sentence then how can the rest of the lines be possible 'corrections' unless since we already have the correct sentence we are really trying to instead find the least bad incorrect sentence out of the list given,public,hw2

question a,in question are we using the a graph search or tree search,public,hw1
csp forward checking backtracking,hi all while performing your constraint satisfaction computation there is a slightly nuanced point that you should keep in mind when you have set a variable and are performing forward checking if you find that a variable has no possible values left you should perform a step of backtracking so if you find that you are coming up with a solution to the csp problem with no backtracking you should take a second look at your trace and make sure you are counting instances where forward checking results in an impossibility forcing the algorithm to backtrack jon,public,hw1
problem manhattan distance to goal,the description of the heuristics in the handout says experiment with two heuristics euclidean distance and manhattan distance to the goal grid for the manhattan distance to goal grid heuristic should we take obstacles into account or do an overall distance like the euclidean heuristic i e should the heuristic of the start position to the goal position of the example map be as an overall distance or with obstacles thanks,public,hw1

beam search worse state edge case,hi all there has been a couple questions regarding how beam search handles the case when the best successor of a beam is actually worse than the current beam's value the correct behavior of beam search in this case is to make the beams worse at least temporarily by exploring the worse states the idea is that no beam ever stops growing even if it gets worse in the end however we always keep track of the best state that we've found along the way for instance if we were running beam search with k and the ith iteration of the algorithm found beams with values and and out of all the successors of these beams the best states are and we would update our beams to be and not this may seem counter intuitive but beams never stay put we would note that we got a however and would return this if we never found a better state after beam search concludes jon,public,hw1
number of states,hi the number of states for bfs is the matching but the number of states for a is not matching i tried several changes but none of them work for all the test cases for some of the small ones it is matching but for the large ones it is not matching,public,hw1
is bfs on the sample room configuration problem supposed to take a while,given that we need to add all of these nodes in a tree search and each addition takes n time given the spec of stable pq addition and we can expect to have pops this should result in an n runtime of a very large number it's taking my computer an incredibly long time to get through it all has anyone else experienced this,public,hw1

important note on problem heuristics,we have come to realize that problem is a bit incomplete for the proof about heuristic dominance you are allowed to assume one of the statements listed below your choice a all nodes enqueued with an f value equal to the cost of the shortest path to the goal are dequeued before the goal state b all nodes enqueued with an f value equal to the cost of the shortest path to the goal are dequeued after the goal state i e never without assumptions such as these the thing you are asked to prove isn't always true if you've already been working on this problem we apologize for just releasing this now,public,hw1
