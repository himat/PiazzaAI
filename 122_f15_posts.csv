spring q task,in this question we are supposed to implement graph getweight graph g vertex v vertex w and there is a precondition given to us that requires graph hasedge g v w in addition is graph g is required however in the solution when traversing through vertex v's adjacency list they are still checking to see if the edge does not exist if not the function returns i thought we wouldnt have to check for this because if none of the requires assertions fail then it must be gaurenteed that vertex w would be in vertex v's adjacency list is my reasoning incorrect,public,final_exam
avl tree lecture notes question,i'm reviewing the lecture note on avl trees and if i understood exercise correctly the problem in the rebalance right function lies in an assertion that height t right left height t right right when the right subtree is unbalanced if this is ensured then i think the tree can't deviate from what the diagrams show i'm thinking that means the precondition is requires height t right height t left height t right left height t right right but this only pushes the responsibility of this requirement to tree insert where it has to prove this precondition to ensure the safety of the code it sounds like the postcondition of tree insert has to include a statement like the height of t doesn't change or the height of t and exactly one of its children increased by with this postcondition you can show the precondition of rebalance right is satisfied and you can prove this postcondition too base case t actually null 's height increases by and it has no children otherwise t was an avl tree at most one of its children's height increased by depending on which part of the if branch you're in by the properties of an avl tree either t's height doesn't change when its children have no height changes when the lower height child had the increase or when the tree rebalanced or the height of the two children were the same just prior to adding an element making t and only one of its children have a height increase of problem is this can't be programmed as a postcondition in c since you can't store the former height of the subtrees as a variable for the assertion to use is there supposed to be a different issue with the code or is there actually a way to add that statement as a postcondition of tree insert,public,final_exam
c overflow,i am going over the c safety questions and am wondering if i have the right understanding from my understanding overflow is dealt with for unsigned ints via implemented modular arithmetic but not so for signed ints so overflow would be considered whenever i perform an arithmetic operation and it exceeds either the min or max values for our representation type,public,final_exam
tree height definition,the lecture notes for avl trees contains the following definition of tree height we need the concept of tree height which we define as the maximal length of a path from the root to a leaf so the empty tree has height the tree with one node has height a balanced tree with three nodes has height if a tree has just one node the root node isn't the maximum length of a path from the root to a leaf not similarly wouldn't the maximum root to leaf path length of a balanced node bst be not,public,final_exam

doubts on pointers and casting in c,when we have an array of chars and we cast in to an int is it considered undefined behaviour as an int need at least bytes and a char is only byte if we have an array of chars and we cast it to an int is it agin undefined behaviour or is it okay to more memory while casting even when it is not a perfect multiple of the size of the cast what happens to the last byte of memory in this case string representations as pointers and arrays is there any difference between the following initialisations of the string hello world a char str helloworld b char str helloworld c char str str helloworld are all these implementation read only or are are any of them writable also also does pointer arithmetic work with strings for example would the following code work char str helloworld str str expected to point to the null terminator finally does pointer arithmetic work with void pointers also what is sizeof void or sizeof void,public,final_exam

unsigned int,just a general question the handout says that one way to deal with signed int overflow is to use unsigned types since theoretically speaking it is always possible for a function or a loop to reach large input or unexpectedly to zero does this mean that in the test we have better to use unsigned int unless otherwise specified more generally when we code unless we need to compare the values of integers do we by default prefer unsigned int to signed int thanks,public,final_exam

c code,int f ohno int a bug a is deallocated when f ohno returns return a my understanding of what happens when this code is executed is that some memory for a is allocated on the system stack the function then returns the address of a however when it returns it frees all its local variable and so the address that it had returned as the address of the variable a is no longer the address of the variable a is that address unallocated or does it point to some other memory is my understanding correct also would this considered undefined behaviour or would it only be considered undefined behaviour if we tried to dereference the address returned by this function without every allocating memory to it,public,final_exam

how can you free a bitvector,so i don't understand from the handout whether we are supposed to free the bitvectors we allocate to the heap or are we just not allowed to store them there task says your implementation should be free of memory leaks as reported by valgrind regard less of whether your main function returns or your implementation should also work regardless of the way bit vectors are implemented this seems hard to do without a bitvector free function which according to part we shouldn't implement because we are using c an array implementation would presumably lead to lead to unrecoverable memory leaks because we don t expose a bitvector free function we will compile your code that uses bit vectors against such other implementations including an implementation that is a bool array aside from memory leaks your code for tasks should work with these other implementations in other words for the remainder of the assignment you should respect the bitvector interface you shouldn t assume you know anything about how a bit vector is implemented if whenever i make a pointer to a bitvector i free it later is that enough it seems like it would fail on the array implementation and i'm not sure if that is okay,public,lightsout

recitation checkpoint solutions,not every recitation was able to go over the solutions to checkpoint so here they are a this function returns the address of x a local variable when this function returns all local variables disappear so it would be undefined behavior to read the returned address since it points to a variable that is no longer defined in general be very careful when using the operator to get addresses to local variables since those variables could go out of scope b the for loop in this program iterates from to some multiple of sizeof int is implementation defined however a i is the same thing as a i so this may cause the program to index past the end of the array c when you define a string using double quotation marks in c it is called a string literal and resides in a special part of memory that is read only this program tries to change the contents of a literal string which cannot be done also d note that the if condition if x instead of x this is actually valid c you're allowed to put assignments inside if and while conditions since the assignment evaluates to the value assigned in this case line assigns to x and then evaluates to which is interpreted as true causing woo to be printed out e s is declared as a char array but the programmer forgot to add a null terminator ' ' or nul thus when line tries to print it out printf doesn't know when to stop reading bytes since there's no nul char so it keeps reading causing undefined behavior probably either printing garbage segfaulting or both f print int attempts to free i but main passed a pointer to a local variable to it a stack address you should only free pointers that you got from malloc or calloc doing otherwise is undefined behavior pindefinedbehavior,public,recitations

what size hash table,i am pondering what the size of the hash table should be for task of ropes to create a good hash table with the correct capacity as a client we need to have knowledge of the kind of data for which we will be using the hash set we do know that we will be using it on strings but exactly what kinds of strings will they have many branches and subtrees or not we need more information if we pick an arbitrary value of say then it would be efficient for some kinds of data but not efficient at all for other kinds of data but if we wanted to reduce the number of collisions as much as possible we could calculate the maximum possible number of branches based on the rope length of each item in a and then sum those numbers to obtain one massive number this would work for really small values of a and small lengths for elements in a but overflow otherwise if we wanted to prevent overflow but not have too many collisions we could create a hash table of size int max but i don't think autolab can actually allocate an array of size int max the handout doesn't specify a capacity for the hash table we must create and we have limited knowledge of the data we will be working with what size hash table should we create or is it possible if we could have some more knowledge of the data for which the project will be used so that we could write an algorithm that decides the appropriate size for the hash table,public,ropes

is the buffer allowed to be at left,in tbuf implementation if you have two nodes in dll and your pointer is to the second what happens when you delete the leftmost char but not the last if you were to delete would the pointer have to automatically move to the first node instead of being at the left of a non empty node or would the pointer stay at the second node at the left of the buffer example where we start start 'first node ' ' lmost left' end scenario after delete moves to first node start 'first node ' ' lmost left' end scenario after delete stays on the left of the buffer start 'first node ' 'a lmost left' end,public,editor

tips with debugging editor,this is from last fall i have noticed certain things while debugging if running with d causes issues is tbuf may have an infinite loop like mine did if your program is broken you can have issues with getting back to the shell to get out of coin broken e use ctrl z z this puts the process in the background to exit that type yourandrewid unix yourpathhere ps this will give you a list of all processes running under your user id note any lines with coin cc is you use x e or rlwrap coin is aliased for rlwrap coin if you went through gpi setup look at the number under pid this is the process id then type where you substitute the number under pid in pidhere yourandrewid unix yourpathhere kill pidhere this should kill your process also if you exit messily your cursor may disappear just use the reset command note that this appears to make all of the output disappear so make sure to save any relevant stack traces x may cause extra issues,public,editor

is type done entirely with assertions,i was thinking why can't we do is type type t entirely with assertions like so bool is type type t assert t null assert length t data t len return true the logic being that we must use assertions for the is expected length function anyways and the whole point of the is type function is to generate an assertion error this is better because it is more concise no funny is expected length function and it actually fails on the line you need it to instead short circuiting and returning false then failing on the assert all the way at the calling function in when you have no idea which condition it failed,public,lectures

analysis grade,i just checked my gradebook on autolab and saw that doslingos was graded however i seemed to be missing some points so i opened up the score view my analysis section did not have a score it only said so i was wondering if this section is yet to be graded or if this means that i got a on my analysis all the other sections have scores thanks in advance,public,doslingos
question a,i'm just double checking to make sure the way i'm correctly interpreting the language of something that was stated in the question if the array resizes to be twice as large as soon as it is full as in lecture and resizes to be half as large as soon as it is strictly less than half full so for example does that mean that if i have an array of size and limit and i add an element to it it becomes full size is now and also it immediately resizes so becoming limit of in other words is there no point based on the language in the question at which the size is and the limit is when you are adding in lecture i got the impression that it was once the array was already full and the next element was added there would need to be an array resize and of the tokens charged for that addition would cover that element's own array write the banked tokens would cover the writes for the other existing elements into the new array and leaving tokens in the bank for the future also is a single removal considered an array write when we are showing our sequence of adds and removals when we use arr add we do an array write i'm assuming that a removal of element takes write as well,public,written7

theory question clac and random memory access,as far as i can tell clac can't even change the values of any numbers deeper than layers into the stack without dropping data since swap and rot only change the top or top numbers therefore i can't declare more than mutable variables spots used var var accumulator and i'm sure there are algorithms that need more than mutable variables in general does the stack grow in proportion to the number of memory writes done in an algorithm like how a read only turing machine has to copy all its memory to a new location every time it has to change variable or is it indeed possible to edit any value in the stack in isolation i don't see how this can be done without a temporary stack which cannot be made without losing access to the original stack,public,clac

important memory concept,hi i noticed a common problem on the written homeworks that i felt was worth mentioning to everyone it's clearest with an example pardon my bad handwriting let's say in the images above that a is of the type int and b is of the type int a lot of people on written homework answered some of the questions assuming that both of these scenarios are the same however that is not true one would think that they're the same since b a and b in both cases however the difference comes in how memory is allocated in the first image there is memory allocated for an int which contains a pointer to that is equivalent to a this means that b is allocated in memory b a but b is not a however in the second image there is no memory allocated for b b a and b is a it's a small but important concept to understand and i feel that enough people on the written homework missed this idea to warrant a small note amolak,public,written5

pre conditions and bad proofs,this post is about a mis understanding we've seen in your loop invariants and function correctness proofs to be brief we want to correct the assumption that just because it's in the pre condition it is universally true which we can quickly prove false a simple example would be an array searching function now this is a special array searching function it has some magic inside its blackbox this is short for saying we're not allowed to know what it does inside it returns the index of the array element you were searching for but doesn't guarantee anything as a postcondition about the array you passed in see why this important later the only pre conditions for this function are int magic search int in array int element requires is in element in array requires is sorted in array ensures a result element we can only assume this has at least one loop it might have loops somehow it still has o searching magic well it turns out that this is a big headfake the magic turned out to be that the magic search function completely modifies the array ok it's probably not actually o gutting the array of every other element and replacing them with the element we are searching for silly right but here's where the lesson comes in how does one go about proving the correctness of this function searching for this function required that the in array was sorted but could we use this pre condition for the loop invariants and our overall proof no the array in array is modified in the loops so both pre conditions are no longer valid ingredients for the correctness proof make sure you understandwhy as in array was in the pre condition and then modified inside the loops we can no longer reason without operational reasoning that the pre conditionsare still true inside the function's loop s and upon returning the proof of this function would require separate reasoning from the pre conditions which allow it to reason over the modified in array array enough toprove that it ensures a result element how does this apply to you too many times do we see proofs or invalid loop invariants that greatlydepend on the inputs which have some property proven about them in thepre conditions being as solid as a rock but then we tell you that theserocks are thrown around inside the function and you still assume they'reintact don't do that rocks can break good luck with midterm pinsforpreconditions,public,other

code segfaults at different times with or without d,i am trying to test sort by freq but my am getting a segfault when running the code on the dictionary given i do not get a segfault in smaller cases however when i run with d enabled the code segfaults with around terms sorted and merged rather than the sorted that happens without d since these seem to be entirely arbitrary times in both cases i am quite confused for reference my code is mergesort implemented by sorting both halves creating a pair of arrays one for ints and another for strings running a recursive merge that puts the sorted result in the new arrays and then putting the sorted arrays back in the old arrays any help would be appreciated,public,doslingos
task final question,how many times are there fewer words with frequency f than there are with frequency f the usual pattern is that there are lots of words that appear time fewer or the same number of words that appear times and so on how many times is this pattern violated i'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this so we have a frequency f with a certain number of words that appear in the corpus f times the question is asking how many times does it happen where the number of words with frequency f is strictly lower than the number of words with frequency f is my thinking correct here,public,doslingos

written problem e question,sorry i guess it's a little late to ask questions about written but i already asked a few tas about problem part e and they all didn't know why the official answer is better than what i wrote so i decided to ask here the question asks for a new loop invariant to add to a square root program to make it correct my answer was to use loop invariant k i i n but the official answer is loop invariant n i i n i'm sure the postcondition can be ensures result result n result result n since this would work for all valid n including and it describes what the program does in practice it took me a while to understand how the official answer can prove the postcondition and it's a long process i can't find a simpler way here's my version of the proof k n negation of loop guard k i i loop invariant i i n and i result line result result n and n precondition case a n first case a n inequality properties a n i i n new loop invariant a i i n a 's first half evaluates to false by a a result result n result result n a and and case b n second case b i i b and b i i n loop invariant b i i integers only b i i i i square both sides b i i b 's first half evaluates to false by b b i i solve quadratic equation b i b 's second half evaluates to false by b b i subtraction properties b i i square both sides b i i n b and b b result result n result result n b and and but with my loop invariant the proof can be done in fewer steps and it will still successfully get to the postcondition here's my proof that the postcondition can be shown with this loop invariant k n negation of loop guard n precondition k transitive property of comparison k i i loop invariant i i n and i result line result result n and k i i n new loop invariant i i n 's first half evaluates to false by result result n result result n and and also the ta's said that using loop invariant i i i n is wrong but i think a proof can also be made in that case though not as short k n negation of loop guard n precondition k transitive property of comparison k i i loop invariant i i n and i result line result result n and i i and i i solve quadratic inequality i loop invariant i 's second half evaluates to false by i i i n new loop invariant i i n 's first half evaluates to false by result result n result result n and and the only reason why this proof might not be allowed is the fact that it had to solve a quadratic inequality but as far as i can tell i have to solve a quadratic equation in the proof for the official answer why is that answer accepted instead also the answer i gave didn't even need to solve a quadratic equation or inequality to prove the postcondition all three loop invariants can fix the bug where the program just before the start of the loop multiplies by and compares the result to n which would cause an error if n and all three loop invariants are sufficient to prove the postcondition what makes one answer accepted over another then,public,written1
about substituting in the masked intensity,can i get a hint for how to substitute in the masked intensity thank you so much,public,images
mask array as input,are we supposed to make our own mask modeling the examples given in the mask txt files or use the ones provided also do we hardcode into our blur c the mask array or does that take care of itself when we do m blur mask txt when we compile thanks in advance,public,images

blur,i tried many times of blur function and i kept failing on the last two test cases i'm wondering what they are about and how i could probably fix my bug thanks,public,images
general tip for code that looks perfect but doesn't work,i've only noticed this using bash but if your program is coded correctly but is not functioning try auto formatting the code by opening the doc and then hitting escape like you are going to exit and then typing gg g this text won't show up anywhere as you type it and you have to be a little quick but once you've done it it should auto format your code i noticed this when trying to check my code using coin coin catches misaligned text and tells you where it is but i believe and maybe on of the instructors can correct me that misaligned code does not compile in my case it ignored a return after an if statement and always returned at the other return causing my code to fail every test case despite being correct except for alignment that said code that looks perfect may still not be perfect and this won't fix that,public,other
segmentation fault,is there a way to find what causes a segmentation fault or what line of code causes this to happen,public,images
running reflect transform,my code is compiling but when i run the file i'm stuck at running reflect transform is this due to inefficient code or is something else wrong thanks,public,images
expected file to exist and it did not,i finished reflect c and i checked the imagediff the code works and the compared images are the same when i submitted to autolab however i got this error checking for the existence of reflect test test failed expected the file to exist and it did not hint reflect tests did not compile skipping what is wrong,public,images

require entries in int mask non negative in contract,do we need to require every entry of int mask to be non negative in contracts of blur and helper functions if necessary,public,images
blur comp reflect test,a previous post asks about arrayutil and its error in autolab however my autolab won't grade reflect and blur because it can't find blur comp and reflect test i have looked through the readme txt again and all the files included in the initial tar package however i cannot find these files in the interest of not wasting more submissions what is the solution to this should i just make empty files with those names and submit them testing task reflect checking for the existence of reflect test test failed expected the file to exist and it did not hint reflect tests did not compile skipping testing task blur checking for the existence of blur comp test failed expected the file to exist and it did not hint blur tests did not compile skipping,public,images
preconditions for unexposed functions,are repeated preconditions necessary for unexposed functions my blur function has the following preconditions valid mask valid imagesize length of result length of original picture my blur helper function has the following preconditions valid mask basically copy pasted from blur valid imagesize basically copy pasted from blur basically some helper functions have largely the same preconditions as the main function that is calling them if the helper functions isn't exposed and the variables don't change its kind of pointless to just copy paste the same preconditions in front of all your functions,public,images
task,is task asking us to fill in the bodys and conditions for all the functions in imageutil c but our version of the imageutil c interface won't actually be used for grading our other files right,public,images
using arrayutil on images lab,if you are having issues with autolab not finding arrayutil when you submit despite it compiling on your computer here is the solution remove all statements of the form use file c from your code when testing on andrew you should be compiling all the files you need together anyway when you call cc the autograder does the same thing but our files may have different names from yours leading to compiler errors note that statements of the form use are fine these are used to reference built in libraries such as conio or util if you need functions from arrayutil c copy and paste them into your file autolab doesn't have access to the arrayutil c file the arrayutil functions can be found at this page if the function you want to use depends on other arrayutil functions also copy those make sure you cite your source in a comment above the functions you copy please let us know in a followup below if you run into any issues,public,images
blur mask starting position,for the blur task i am wondering where should we start blurring the image do we put the mask at the top left corner first and then do the same to the other n n squares in the image and those that are on the edge moreover we should only perform the n n mask on each n n block in the original image once right or do we need to perform the mask blurring with its origin at every pixel in the image once,public,images
written posted due mon sep by pm,written is now posted on the course website it is due on monday sept by pm you can hand in during lab or in the box outside of ghc on monday if you want to hand in early you can drop off at ghc card access required during the weekend good luck tom frank penny,public,written4
about blur,in the handout for blur it says that the mask is an n by n array but since mask is an array of int not array of arrays how can we possibly assess if mask is square or not thank you so much,public,images
overflow,when question asks you to require that width height should not overflow does that mean the value returned should not be negative when the modular arithmetic would loop it around to make the product negative or does it mean that it should be only less than the bits,public,images

preconditions for blur function,or if the mask contains negative integers or a zero at the origin your program should abort with a precondition failure when compiled and run with the d flag just confused on the wording here can the mask not have any negative integers or can it only not have them at the origin,public,images

c function pointers,function pointers are not described anywhere in the language reference but in coin running int a a produces use address of ' f' only for functions 'f' ' heavily implying that perhaps c does have function pointers does c have function pointers they would be really helpful so i'm hoping the answer is yes,public,images

insertion sort proof from recitation,hey all we realize that the proof of the correctness of insertion sort that we went through in recitation today may have been confusing so i'll try to reproduce it below of course feel free to ask a ta in office hours if something still doesn't make sense but try to read this first first make sure you understand how insertion sort works it works by iterating through an array and building a sorted subarray behind it as it goes along by swapping new elements into the sorted subarray i encourage you to check out the visualization here to get a better intuition to how it works outer loop invariants initially true line initially i so the loop invariant is true since and n from line line is sorted a checks that the empty range is sorted so the loop invariant is vacuously true inner loop invariants initially true line j i so i is true from line and i i is true line j i so this is true from line line j i so the loop invariant is checking is sorted a i i but this range encompasses a single element which is always sorted line j i so the loop invariant is checking le segs a i a i i but the second range is i i which is an empty range it is vacuously true that every element in the first range is less than or equal to every element in the second range because there are no elements in the second range inner loop invariants preservation note that j' j and i' i and a j and a j were swapped in the course of the loop iteration i convert primed variables to unprimed variables to be consistent below line from the loop guard j so since j is an integer j so j' also if j i then clearly j i thus j' i line we want to show is sorted a j' is sorted a j that is the elements in a from to j inclusive are sorted but we know is sorted a j so those elements were sorted before this iteration and during the iteration none of these elements were modified a j was but it's not part of the range so they must still be sorted line from the loop guard we know a j which ends up in the j th position is smaller than a j which ends up in the jth position which is smaller due to the loop invariant on line since j is in the first range than every element from j to i inclusive and we know that the array is sorted from j to i inclusive from the loop invariant on line thus the whole range from j to i inclusive is sorted afterwards line we want to show le segs a j a j i we already know le segs a j a j i from the loop invariant on line since no elements in those two ranges were modified it remains to show that a j is greater than or equal to every element from to j but we know this is true since it was sorted from the loop invariant on line inner loop invariants termination j is positive initially and monotonically decreases to so it must terminate outer loop invariants preservation note that i' i and n' n line i initially from line so clearly i so i' also from the loop guard we get i n so i n so i' n line we want to show is sorted a i from the negation of the loop guard we know either j combining with line or a j a j in the first case line shows is sorted a i in the second case we have is sorted a j a j a j and is sorted a j i which all together show is sorted a i outer loop invariants termination n i is positive initially and monotonically decreases to so it must terminate can you just say i n and i is monotonically increasing and is bounded by n yes but we prefer you to find a quantity that is positive and monotonically decreasing to proof of the postcondition i n from the negation of the outer loop guard and line thus from line we get is sorted a n,public,recitations

how do i import pixel c into tasks c,i'm not sure what respecting interface means even after reading most of piazza posts and writeup carefully but now i'm guessing that it means i should only use functions from pixel c to write functions in tasks c then does this assignment want us to copy the functions from pixel c or is there a way to import all the functions from that file into tasks c,public,pixels

should we derive safety only from contract statements,if int i starts from and all it does is increase can we just assume that i is larger than but there aren't any specific contract statements would it be okay to prove the safety just by stating how i changes on question b when proving the safety of the array access it doesn't seem like we could do this assuming that the given answer is unsupported also how would you prove that a safety is unsupported in situation like this is it possible to come up with a counter example if this statement is intuitively safe thanks,public,written2
if statement conditional after a loop,for problem d in written homework is it valid to use the conditional in the if statement as part of our logical argument as to why safety is supported or unsupported the if occurs after the loop has terminated so as per the directions i know we can use the negation of the loop guard and also the preservation of any loop invariants once the loop has terminated but what if the safety in question is for a function call that only occurs specifically when a certain if conditional is met thanks,public,written2

is there an analog of the sizeof operator,i realize the point may be moot considering there is no such thing as stack allocation in the vm so everything should be or but i was reading the stl reference and saw that 'util' exports a constant int size and it got me thinking if there were a more general way to request the sizes of arbitrary types,public,c0vm

how to use piazza effectively,as many of you may know piazza is a system for asking and answering questions about lectures assignments logistics exams quizzes and anything else related to the course it's typically an extremely useful tool for getting your ideas answered and questions answered when using piazza and asking questions please keep in mind the following guidelines think before you ask the instructors and tas of the course want to help you help yourself make sure to make your questions detailed enough for us to understand the basics of the problem you're having importantly if you need help debugging a problem with code don't just paste the code in a private post and ask what's wrong also please don't post an autolab result and ask for hints we want you to think about the code you write just like in office hours make sure you have isolated the bug to a few functions or parts of your code or a failing test that you've written from there we'll try to help you get unstuck but you may find that you figure it out just by taking steps to write tests and debug especially if the question is one you should be able to answer on your own tas may wait for some time after a post has been made before they respond there are a couple of reasons for this first we want to encourage students to help one another and this gives time for composing a student response second we want you all to learn the art of talking to the duck see http www codinghorror com blog rubber duck problem solving html and thinking through problems on your own make sure to answer your own question delete your question or change the post from a question to a note if you work it out yourself in order to not waste the course staff's time check for redundant questions before asking the question search for it on the bar on the left someone may have already asked it be active in the course both answering and asking that said do ask and answer questions actively one of the best ways to understand concepts is to teach it to others be sure not to just give the direct answer or write fully coded implementations in your answers in fact we will delete answers like these help your classmates think by giving hints without just revealing the answer moreover make as many posts public as possible so they help the maximum number of students the question you asked will most likely be on other people's minds unless the question is personal or involves your own code you should probably make it a public question feel free to mark yourself as anonymous don't reveal answers details of homework assignments piazza is a public forum don't send your code in a public post for everyone to see there are academic integrity issues here see the course website for more info on academic integrity if you definitely need to post source code you've written please make it a private post with just you and the instructors if it's code from lectures or other course materials that everyone can see feel free to post it publicly however if as long as you're not posting code you're not going to get in trouble for helping a fellow student on piazza without getting a fair warning first i mean if someone asks what's the answer to b and you say the answer is we're gonna have a chat but short of that be nice etc go out of your way to others feel welcome this is both self explanatory and harder than it sounds finally to get the point for task in programming assignment modify your salute function so that salute returns welcome make sure to change the precondition appropriately to account for the fact that is a valid input pinterest,public,logistics
